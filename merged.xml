Do you need special equipment? How do you know if you’re doing it right? What are the basics, and how do you take your practice to the next level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the series &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/series/how-to-start"&gt;How to start&lt;/a&gt;, we ask experts to break down how to start, well, anything – including running, dating, cooking and lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure out what you enjoy by checking out a variety of books from the library, but don’t force it. If you’re not enjoying a volume, put it down and move on to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with short books and whichever medium – physical books, ebooks or audiobooks – works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make reading fun and sociable by sharing books with friends, or joining a book club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about your dreams more – way more. Start by keeping a dream journal and recording your dreams every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultivate the intention to lucid dream. While you’re awake, think: “The next time I have a dream, I’m going to figure out it’s a dream,” says Dr Ken Paller, professor of psychology at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wake-Back-to-Bed (WBTB) and Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (Mild) techniques can be effective ways to try to lucid dream – but don’t try it more than two to three times a week as they can be tiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to teach a dog as many commands – some trainers call them cues – as they might think. Two cues – “sit” and “come” – are essential for minimizing behavioral issues and recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides basic safety commands, think about training functionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no need to spend hours on training. Sessa says she usually suggests her clients work with their dogs for no more than 10 to 15 minutes a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begin in a plank position, with your hands and toes on the ground and feet set wide or narrow. Lower yourself until your body is almost touching the ground, keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle. Then push yourself back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to maintain correct form, with a line from head to heels, and don’t rush through reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have the basic tools for cooking: a chef’s knife, a cutting board, a a nonstick pan, baking sheets and spatulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality spices and pantry staples can improve your cooking. Stock up on good kosher salt, fresh black pepper, olive oil, a neutral oil (like canola oil or avocado oil) for high temperature cooking, a couple of vinegars, bags of rice and some beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch a knife skills class (many are free online) to master essential techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try recipes that will teach you core cooking skills, like a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/08/how-to-make-the-perfect-lentil-soup-recipe-felicity-cloake"&gt;lentil soup&lt;/a&gt;, to learn how to time sauteing and simmering; or a three-egg &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/sep/18/how-to-make-a-classic-french-omelette-recipe-felicity-cloake"&gt;omelet&lt;/a&gt;, to learn heat control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleansers:&lt;/strong&gt; Start and end your day with a gentle cleanser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moisturizers:&lt;/strong&gt; For all skin types, moisturizers heal and protect the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunscreen:&lt;/strong&gt; No matter the weather, always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen – at least SPF 30 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate running and walking.&lt;/strong&gt; Run for short periods, then walk to recover – this makes the workout more manageable. Over time, you can increase the period of time running, and aim to take fewer walking breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid running too fast or too much. &lt;/strong&gt;Keep a conversational pace, where you can talk and run at the same time and be sure to take time off as your body adjusts to the new routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get good running shoes. &lt;/strong&gt;Buying in-person is best, especially if you can visit a running store where you can get properly fitted and try a wide variety of shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t push yourself to run as long and far as you can.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be draining and lead to injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2026/jan/02/how-to-start-expert-tips"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50cb15c71d77173ca58a03dfc5d54aeaa6863deb/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.png?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b510d36333447292e1945f52b91e206f" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Jewish groups warned ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans attending match could be seen as ‘antisemitic’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2026/jan/02/jewish-groups-warned-ban-on-maccabi-tel-aviv-fans-attending-match-could-be-seen-as-antisemitic</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2026/jan/02/jewish-groups-warned-ban-on-maccabi-tel-aviv-fans-attending-match-could-be-seen-as-antisemitic</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 19:51:28 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Minutes obtained under freedom of information laws show West Midlands police flagged concerns over decision ahead of Aston Villa match&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewish communities warned West Midlands police that a ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans attending a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/06/six-arrested-during-protests-outside-match-between-aston-villa-and-maccabi-tel-aviv"&gt;match against Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;

The Swiss ski resort was well known to them, having spent summers here with their families, and a big draw was marking the new year in the bar that in recent years had become known as the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight from the group managed to escape the inferno that ripped through Le Constellation, killing about 40 people, while three are among the 80 who were critically injured. Two of the eldest, Marco, 20, and Gabriele, 18, had planned to join their friends in the venue – appreciated by young people for being an affordable place to party in a resort popular with celebrities and wealthy skiers – shortly after midnight but by a last-minute twist of fate decided not to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/02/crans-montana-fire-families-agonising-wait-victims-identification"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8543618a50db2d1456a8475b3a0644cb8d34f720/83_0_6321_5057/master/6321.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=ead663116364fb197b09d0520796c2b6" medium="image"/></item><item><title>US homeland security condemned for using Japanese artist’s work without consent</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/homeland-security-japanese-artist-permission</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/homeland-security-japanese-artist-permission</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 19:10:34 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Hiroshi Nagai, in a post on X, has objected to his artwork being used by the agency to promote its deportation agenda &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Homeland Security is facing backlash once again, this time from a Japanese artist who has condemned the agency for using his work without permission to promote deportations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post on X on New Year’s Eve, DHS posted a photo featuring a pristine and empty beach with palm trees and a vintage car.

They also signal the state’s ongoing role&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outcomes for children who grow up in care are shocking. A vital part of the welfare state, which exists to promote the safety and wellbeing of highly vulnerable young people, is falling short in health, education and employment terms. They have a &lt;a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/innovative-data-use-reveals-childrens-care-system-outcomes/"&gt;62% higher chance&lt;/a&gt; of dying before the age of 75 than their peers, and are four times as likely to have a criminal conviction or caution. While the number of children in the care system in England has fallen from its all-time high of 83,750 in 2023, the latest figure of &lt;a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/children-looked-after-in-england-including-adoptions/2025#releaseHeadlines-tables"&gt;81,770 in March&lt;/a&gt; last year is still 17.7% higher than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recently announced raft of reforms, including free prescriptions for care leavers, will not solve all of the problems. The dire financial position of many councils, and depleted state of local services, have a particularly damaging impact on the lives of those who rely most on the state. One survey last year found that the &lt;a href="https://www.communitycare.co.uk/content/news/social-work-remains-councils-biggest-recruitment-and-retention-challenge-survey-finds"&gt;recruitment and retention of social workers&lt;/a&gt; was the biggest workforce challenge that English councils face.

Think of it instead as a hope or even a plea for the next 12 months. May the coming year see those leaders who have done so much damage to their own countries, and far beyond, at last be called to account. Let 2026 be a year of reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with the man whose reach is longest, by dint of the mighty power he wields. Such is the nature of the US electoral system that Donald Trump, who returned to power less than a year ago, will face the judgment of voters in 10 months’ time. His name will not be on the ballot but, make no mistake, the midterm elections of 3 November will deliver a verdict on the second Trump presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This should be his big year, the make-or-break 2026. Last year his Reform party finally began to top the polls and he was feted by Washington as the UK’s Trump and &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/09/18/farage-trump-knows-ill-be-next-pm/"&gt;next prime minister&lt;/a&gt;. So how now would he turn a sheaf of poll results into a disciplined election-winning machine? Or has he for the past year merely been doing what most third parties do at this stage of a parliament, which is feast on the misfortune of their opponents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polls sent Reform surging into a steady lead last spring. It held that position through the summer, with a high of &lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/voting-intention"&gt;29%&lt;/a&gt; according to YouGov, and &lt;a href="https://x.com/LukeTryl/status/1975837194050019588"&gt;33%&lt;/a&gt; according to More in Common. But pollsters now suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/reform-uk-yougov-poll-labour-nigel-farage-b2889430.html"&gt;Farage’s party may have peaked&lt;/a&gt; – with YouGov’s December polling showing a drop in its vote share to 26%, its lowest since April. Some of this has been credited to &lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/53741-political-favourability-ratings-december-2025"&gt;increasing support&lt;/a&gt; for the Tory leader Kemi Badenoch and to the joint Lib Dem/Green vote surging to nearly 30%. It seems likely that this confusion will survive through this May’s local elections.

What’s the excuse  so close to breakfast?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, let me say: I love love. I’m in love – I’m happily married with two boys. I’m surrounded by love, because most of my friends and family are in long-term relationships and have kids of their own. Heck, I even love it when strangers find love. Since its inception, I have watched every episode of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/16/netflix-black-dating-show-pop-the-balloon-tv"&gt;Pop the Balloon or Find Love&lt;/a&gt; – a US reality dating show hosted by Arlette Amuli. While it’s entertaining observing how treacherous the dating market is, I’m more thrilled when two people match and commence their own love journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for all my appreciation of love, public displays of affection (PDAs) on the morning commute should be punishable by prison. I’m talking hugging, kissing, even sitting on each other’s laps – all of the above are abominable to watch. In my dictatorship, those who committed such crimes would be locked up without due process. The British tonguing police (BTP) would ensure that perpetrators were swiftly caught.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;They would not pass go, they would not collect £200. They would go directly to jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Akadiri is a standup comedian and resident doctor.

The first half of the year was properly parched as President Trump’s tariff agenda upset everything: fundraisings from flotations, or initial public offerings (IPOs), were the lowest in a miserable run that started in 2022. But data from Dealogic show there was a notable pick-up in activity in the second half, albeit still billions away from that of 2021, the last strong year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mini-revival will have come as a relief for both the London Stock Exchange and Rachel Reeves. For the former, the dearth of new listings – as opposed to fundraisings by companies already on the exchange – has become an embarrassment in recent years, especially after London &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/14/arm-ipo-share-sale-nasdaq-stock-market"&gt;failed to land Arm Holdings in 2023&lt;/a&gt;.

The GUR military intelligence unit said the ruse &lt;strong&gt;even netted the $500,000 Russian reward for the “killing” of Denis Kapustin&lt;/strong&gt; – also known as Denis Nikitin – leader of the Russian Volunteer Corps and “Timur Special Unit”, which had announced on Saturday that Kapustin was killed on the frontline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, &lt;strong&gt;Kapustin appeared via video link at a briefing with the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov&lt;/strong&gt;. His assassination, the GUR and Timur unit said, “was ordered by the special services of the aggressor state Russia, which allocated half a million dollars to carry out the crime … As a result of a comprehensive special operation [his life] was preserved, and &lt;strong&gt;the circle of individuals was identified: the masterminds within the Russian special services and the perpetrators&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Timur unit announced: “Our side also received a corresponding amount of &lt;strong&gt;funds allocated by Russian intelligence agencies&lt;/strong&gt; for the implementation of this crime.” Budanov said in a video posted online, showing himself and Kapustin: “First of all, Mr Denis, &lt;strong&gt;I congratulate you on returning to life. This is always a pleasure.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m glad that the &lt;strong&gt;funds received from ordering your liquidation went to help our fight&lt;/strong&gt;.” Kapustin, according to the AFP news agency, has a controversial past linked to the far right and football hooliganism, and some of his fighters have voiced neo-Nazi views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian drones struck energy and industrial targets across the Russian regions of Krasnodar, Tatarstan and Kaluga&lt;/strong&gt; overnight into Thursday, local officials said. The attacks started fires the Ilskiy oil refinery in Krasnodar; at an energy storage facility in the city of Almetyevsk, in Tatarstan’s Volga River region; and at an industrial facility in the town of Lyudinovo, in the Kaluga region south-west of Moscow.

Why must we tolerate it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m becoming concerned that we as a species have gone to the dogs – quite literally. Somewhere between the rise of boutique pet grooming and private members’ clubs for canines, dogs appear to have become our preferred species for social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parks, beaches, cafes – even offices and yoga studios, which in the past were areas for human exclusivity, or at least priority – are all frequently shared zones. That means you must joyfully tolerate being sniffed or enthusiastically pranced at. Your belongings, likewise, are subject to dog paws and noses.

Today we examine how the White House’s war on vaccines has left the future of a key technology uncertain and up for grabs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The late scientist and thinker Donald Braben &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/18/we-need-more-scientific-mavericks"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that 20th-century breakthroughs arose from scientists being free to pursue bold ideas without pressure for quick results or rigid peer review. The rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines seemed to validate his claim: emergency conditions sped up &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/coronavirus-help-mRNA-DNA-vaccines/98/i14"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt;, relaxed regulatory sequencing and encouraged&amp;nbsp;scientists to share findings before peer review. Out of that sprang one of the great scientific success stories of our age: mRNA vaccines. These use synthetic genetic code to train the immune system to defend itself against viruses. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman, whose work enabled the mRNA&amp;nbsp;Covid vaccine, went on to win the &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/"&gt;Nobel&lt;/a&gt; prize. Their&amp;nbsp;breakthrough suggests that loosening traditional&amp;nbsp;constraints could accelerate major scientific advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extensive scientific and logistic infrastructure built during that period is now occupied with turning the technology towards other diseases: flu, &lt;a href="https://www.eatg.org/hiv-news/dual-studies-reveal-early-successes-for-mrna-hiv-vaccine-strategies/"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/nhs-cancer-vaccine-launch-pad/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Until very recently, the US, which put more than $10bn into mRNA development, appeared primed to reap the scientific and commercial rewards. Despite the deregulatory zeal that birthed mRNA, the second Trump administration has rejected it. Instead, it has been remarkably steady in its commitment to the radical anti-science and anti-vaccine agenda of the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. He has spent the past year undermining and outright &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/hhs-cancels-766m-bird-flu-vaccine-contract-with-moderna/?utm_source=&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=24-364338&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=&amp;amp;amp;cf-view&amp;amp;amp;cf-view&amp;amp;amp;cf-closed&amp;amp;amp;cf-view"&gt;sabotaging&lt;/a&gt; the US’s own success. Over the summer, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a “coordinated wind-down” of federal funding for mRNA research, cancelling an additional $500m in funding for 22 projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fold some laundry. Stir a risotto. Go for a run, watch a film, try to entertain someone else’s baby: anything that involves pottering about in an undemanding yet still vaguely engaged way, which absolutely couldn’t be classed as work but isn’t totally vegetative either. It may not be the productivity hack any go-getter wants to hear, but it’s surprising how often a spell of aimless noodling around frees an otherwise overworked human brain to make the kind of lateral mental leap that helps everything fall into place. And I’m not just saying that to justify a New Year’s Day spent lying hungover on the sofa, ploughing through the last of the Christmas cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the eminent cancer surgeon &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/391/bmj.r2621.full.pdf"&gt;Michael Baum&lt;/a&gt;, it was a night off with his wife at the theatre that allowed him to suddenly join the dots. After watching a scene in Tom Stoppard’s play Arcadia where one character explains chaos theory to another, Baum had his own personal eureka moment: what if this mathematical concept, used to describe complex systems that may seem haphazard but have a hidden underlying pattern to them, could also explain the otherwise puzzling way in which cancer grows and spreads? The result of that one stray thought as the interval curtain rose was an innovation in chemotherapy, and a gratifying rise in survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/01/difficult-problem-do-nothing-agatha-christie"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507911de53b461a32a16c8b578c68c89d5ff9fd7/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2eed16d3c6de26eec8ca2c88b64e9e21" medium="image"/></item><item><title>New year drone strike kills 24 in Russian-occupied Ukraine, Moscow says</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/new-year-drone-strike-kills-24-in-russian-occupied-ukraine-moscow-says</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/new-year-drone-strike-kills-24-in-russian-occupied-ukraine-moscow-says</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:55:45 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has not commented on attack on cafe and hotel that comes despite ‘productive’ ongoing peace talks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Ukrainian drone strike killed 24 people and injured at least 50 more as they celebrated the New Year in a Russian-occupied village in Ukraine’s Kherson region, Russian officials said, as tensions between the two nations continue to spike despite diplomats hailing productive peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three drones struck a cafe and hotel in the resort town of Khorly on the Black Sea coast, the region’s Moscow-installed leader, Vladimir Saldo, said in a statement on Telegram on Thursday.

Hard to put one’s finger on what’s going on, but it has to do with the sense of an ending, which, if it’s sad at all, isn’t sad-sad; rather, it occupies that category of sadness I think of as the anticipation of future nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/01/new-year-midlife-crisis-50-kids"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29835075600d9878803efdeaf0435c5a7f167972/625_0_6247_4997/master/6247.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5fcfe60a52dc405128fe2098154e975a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>It’s payback time: inside the 2 January Guardian Weekly</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2026/jan/01/its-payback-time-inside-the-2-january-guardian-weekly</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2026/jan/01/its-payback-time-inside-the-2-january-guardian-weekly</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 12:00:39 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Europe’s big, expensive state pensions crisis. &lt;strong&gt;Plus:&lt;/strong&gt; The British culture boom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM53X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home address&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year!

Here’s like what phrases ‘bird theory’ and ‘monkey branching’ mean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year marked a decade since the term “ghosting” hit the mainstream. At the time, the idea that someone could abruptly cease communication with a lover without explanation seemed like the peak of indignity. How naive we were. In the 10 years since, finding a partner has only become more confounding – an oftentimes fruitless exercise in humiliation that is increasingly pigeonholed by social media jargon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-sex-lives-of-gen-z"&gt;Gen Z&lt;/a&gt;, a cohort who came of age during a loneliness epidemic, a masculinity crisis, and a coordinated attack on the rights of women and the LGBTQ+ community, faces a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2025/nov/28/gen-z-sex-dating-relationships"&gt;far messier landscape&lt;/a&gt; than their millennial predecessors could ever imagine.

Examples include calling their exes crazy, subpar tipping habits, a love of Woody Allen films, a burgeoning DJ career …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green flags&lt;/strong&gt; – These quirks validate your decision to pursue a mate. Examples include checking in to make sure you got home safe after a date, low screen time, owning a bed frame …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beige flags&lt;/strong&gt; – These usually describe niche, mostly benign quirks.

(In other words, when they use the second-person pronoun “you” in their communications.) Do you feel like you’re valued? That you’re being treated as an individual?

Whether you agree with him over this or that utterance or the broad sweep of government policy, he has, unquestionably made his contribution to Tottenham, in north London, whose people he has represented for a quarter of a century, to parliament, as a senior MP, as foreign secretary and now as an important figure with several key portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when a lieutenant of Nigel Farage, admittedly no fan of Lammy’s, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/16/richard-tice-refuses-to-condemn-reform-uk-mayoral-candidate-chris-parry-comments-david-lammy"&gt;suggests, without notable contradiction&lt;/a&gt; or condemnation from Reform, that Lammy “should go home to the Caribbean”, one is tempted to look at that askance.

It was an October evening in 2023 and they had travelled from villages, settlements and refugee camps around the region for a mass peace rally jointly organised by the Israeli movement Women Wage Peace and the Palestinian group Women of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the organisers were friends: Yael Admi, 66, an Israeli mother of six, and Reem al-Hajajreh, 43, a Palestinian mother of four. The women had hoped their message would cut through decades of violence and mistrust. But three days later, Hamas launched its deadly attack on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, followed swiftly by what turned into a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry"&gt;genocidal war&lt;/a&gt; by Israel on Gaza which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/29/gaza-death-toll-rises-says-health-ministry"&gt;left more than 70,000 dead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn5wel11pgdo"&gt;most of &lt;/a&gt;whom were women and children.

The Spanish amateur artist was already 81 when her efforts to restore a decent, if unremarkable, fresco of the scourged Christ &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/28/how-monkey-christ-brought-new-life-to-a-quiet-spanish-town"&gt;brought her a renown&lt;/a&gt; that almost destroyed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost overnight, Giménez, who &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/cecilia-gimenez-monkey-christ-mural-dies-spain"&gt;died on Monday&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 94, was stripped of her quiet existence in the north-eastern Spanish town of Borja, and recast as the well-meaning and unwitting creator of what would become known around the English-speaking world as Monkey Christ.

What we know on day 1,408&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine was “10%” away from a peace deal, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;, and his country wanted an end to the war but not at “any cost”. The Ukrainian president, in his New Year’s Eve address, said any agreement needed strong security guarantees. “The peace agreement is 90% ready, 10% remains. And that is far more than just numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Russian ruler, Vladimir Putin, pushes for full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region as part of any deal, &lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy said he did not believe Russia would stop there&lt;/strong&gt;. “Pull out from the Donbas, and it will all be over. That is how deception sounds when translated from Russian – into Ukrainian, into English, into German, into French, and, in fact, into any language in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy said he would not sign a “weak” peace agreement that would only prolong the war.&lt;/strong&gt; “What does Ukraine want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No. We want an end to the war but not the end of Ukraine … Are we tired? Very. Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European leaders and allies meeting in Paris on 6 January will make firm commitments towards &lt;strong&gt;protecting Ukraine after any peace deal with Russia is brokered, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said&lt;/strong&gt; on Wednesday during his New Year Eve’s speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian long-range drones struck the Temp oil depot in the Russian city of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rybinsk&lt;/strong&gt;, sparking a large fire, an official from Kyiv’s SBU domestic security service said on Wednesday. &lt;strong&gt;In Ukraine, a Russian drone attack hit apartment buildings and the power grid in Odesa&lt;/strong&gt;, injuring six people, including children. Officials said Wednesday that four apartment buildings were damaged and the power company DTEK reported significant damage to two energy facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US and European officials agree that Ukraine did not target Putin and his house with drones.&lt;/strong&gt; Donald Trump on Monday appeared to give the Russian claim credence, but on Wednesday the US president shared a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace. A source familiar with the issue said on condition of anonymity that Trump had reposted the editorial after being briefed by the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, on the drone attack allegations. &lt;strong&gt;US national security officials including the CIA determined that the attack did not happen&lt;/strong&gt;, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, as it tried to shore up its claims, &lt;strong&gt;Russia’s defence ministry released video&lt;/strong&gt; including a Russian serviceman standing next to fragments of a device that he said was a downed Ukrainian Chaklun-V drone carrying a 6kg explosive device that had not detonated. “This is laughable,” said Heorhii Tykhyi from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, “both the fact that it &lt;strong&gt;took them two days to produce this&lt;/strong&gt;, and the fact that the things they try to present as evidence basically shows that they are &lt;strong&gt;not serious even about fabricating the story&lt;/strong&gt;. We are absolutely confident that no such attack took place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaja Kallas, the EU’s top diplomat, called Russia’s claims “a deliberate distraction&lt;/strong&gt; … No one should accept unfounded claims from the aggressor who has indiscriminately targeted Ukraine’s infrastructure and civilians since the start of the war.” Reuters said that a Ukrainian briefing paper noted that in the hours after the alleged attack, various Russian officials made extremely similar and likely coordinated comments in public. Residents of a town near Putin’s Novgorod residence heard no sounds of air defences on the night of the alleged attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong-un hailed North Korean troops fighting in an “alien land”&lt;/strong&gt; in a new year message to soldiers, state media reported on Thursday. Without mentioning the Ukraine war, the dictator addressed personnel in what state-run KCNA described as “overseas operations units”. North Korea has sent thousands of troops to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to South Korean and western intelligence agencies, with at least 600 killed and thousands more injured – all having fought under instructions to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US has granted the &lt;strong&gt;majority &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian-owned Serbian oil company NIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a reprieve until 23 January from sanctions targeting Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, a Serbian minister said on Wednesday. Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS) was forced in early December to shut down Serbia’s sole oil refinery, which supplied about 80% of Serbia’s fuel needs. Washington imposed sanctions on NIS demanding the complete exit of Russian shareholders and preventing the refinery from receiving supplies.

Today, the challenges facing the voluntary sector as it attempts to cope with an ongoing funding crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in a parliamentary &lt;a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2024-10-31d.1227.2&amp;amp;amp;s=speaker%3A13480#g1227.4"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; on the voluntary sector, not long after Labour’s huge election victory, the party’s former MP Jeff Rooker evoked the many ways charities hold Britain’s social fabric together. Every week in his local area, he told fellow peers, a &lt;a href="https://www.handstogetherludlow.org.uk/our-projects/mens-shed"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; named Hands Together Ludlow gives food and support to dozens of desperate people, enables others to access benefit entitlements, runs a “shed” workspace that doubles as a place to meet and talk, and rescues individuals overlooked by agencies delivering social services. Volunteers such as these, Lord Rooker observed, “keep society going”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few would disagree. The &lt;a href="https://guardian.ctdonate.org/"&gt;Guardian’s Christmas charity appeal&lt;/a&gt; showcases similarly vital work being undertaken up and down the country. Yet heading into 2026, this vast network of voluntary organisations faces formidable headwinds and an ominous financial &lt;a href="https://acf.org.uk/acf/ACF/Blog/2024/CEO_blog_funding_crisis.aspx"&gt;crunch&lt;/a&gt;. The prolonged impact of austerity, the pandemic and an ongoing cost of living crisis mean that demand for their services continues to rise. But state funding – both from central government and hollowed-out local authorities – has become more and more inadequate, and charitable giving has &lt;a href="https://www.cafonline.org/insights/research/uk-giving-report"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt; to the lowest level since tracking began. Fewer people are volunteering, and costs are dramatically up – not least as a result of the rise in employers’ national insurance contributions, which kicked in last April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/31/the-guardian-view-on-hard-times-for-britains-charities-struggling-to-do-more-with-less"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cc94a490af75ff6dc299e5b00d323d5172c0deb/727_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8eb3e1e7c401193fbb65c6216b54cf98" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Mystery meat and maggot-infested produce: the disturbing reality of US prison food</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/eating-behind-bars-book-prison-food</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/eating-behind-bars-book-prison-food</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:00:15 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In Eating Behind Bars, author Leslie Soble details how food is used to further punish incarcerated people in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At best you get “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/15/irish-tourist-ice-detention"&gt;mystery meat&lt;/a&gt;”.

The forces behind the rollback of abortion rights in Donald Trump’s US are attempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/02/us-anti-abortion-group-expands-campaign-in-uk"&gt;do the same in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.

A perverse rewilding appears to be taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’d be forgiven for thinking that around the world, women’s rights are being concreted over. But in researching our book, Planet Patriarchy, Beatrix Campbell and I found women’s resistance erupting like green shoots through the cracks. In El Salvador, women can receive sentences of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/el-salvador-woman-sentenced-prison-after-miscarriage"&gt;30-50 years&lt;/a&gt; for miscarriages construed to be abortions. Yet feminists have managed to free all 72 women who had been imprisoned for this, using innovative penal and legal strategies. In Russia, feminists have taken to wearing blue and yellow ribbons, the colours of the Ukrainian flag, to signal their anti-war solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rahila Gupta is an anti-racist feminist activist and the co-author, with Beatrix Campbell, of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/planet-patriarchy-9781805262879/"&gt;Planet Patriarchy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/31/women-rights-threat-world-hope-el-salvador-russia-syria"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ad49d520be6b8704a7290303710c501f8294e6a/137_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b4d9094d13e81e2607de997416b67263" medium="image"/></item><item><title>It’s easy to feel powerless about climate chaos.

And it’s hard not to feel despondent and powerless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I joined the Guardian full time in 2019, as the paper’s first environmental justice correspondent, and have reported from across the US and the region over the past six years.

We’ve highlighted the need for government action on making nutritious food affordable, regulating &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/21/ultra-processed-foods-quiz"&gt;ultra-processed foods,&lt;/a&gt; bringing in sugar taxes and banning advertising of unhealthy products to young people, alongside encouraging an increase in physical activity. The solutions are simple: get people to eat more nutritious food and move. The challenge has been implementation, especially in deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

But in 2025, words of depth and courage have been an antidote to numbness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once saw a young glassblower in Istanbul, still new to his craft, shatter a beautiful vase while taking it out of the furnace. The artisan master standing by his side calmly nodded and said something that I still think about. He told him: “You put too much pressure on it, you kept it unbalanced and you forgot that it, too, has a heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year we are leaving behind has been plagued from the start by a series of social, economic, environmental, technological and institutional challenges, all happening with such speed and intensity that we are yet to fully comprehend their impact on our lives, let alone on future generations. As the overwhelming strain of domestic and geopolitical changes continues to build up, I cannot help but remember the man’s words. Too much pressure. Unstable, uncertain and replete with deep inequalities. This could well be the year we forgot that the Earth, too, has a heart.

As is my duty, I have to add to the pile. But does it all have to be quite so sad? Do we have to dutifully trawl through the muck to find some elusive meaning to what we’ve been forced to endure? Unfortunately, yes. It was a tough year (again) and we met it all with a shrug. As we’ve all been made punishingly aware, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/03/6-7-word-numbers-slang"&gt;Dictionary.com’s word of 2025 is “6-7,”&lt;/a&gt; a viral meme slogan which is technically two words. Pretty cheeky of the Dictionary to cheat on their own assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How tragically emblematic of the year we just witnessed. We’re all too apathetic to even complain about getting swindled by a gaggle of word snobs. “Apathy” would have been a better choice for word of the year, considering how we’ve collectively shrugged at every dispiriting development of the last 12 months.

The recently released &lt;a href="https://www.angiolini.independent-inquiry.uk/"&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt; of the Angiolini inquiry is just as devastating: a reminder of what happens when policing fails to face the harm in its own ranks.

Someone must’ve had a lovely weekend, maybe somewhere on the Mediterranean. I only saw the man’s face as he passed me – and suddenly I couldn’t breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew him. He was my father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carolin Würfel is a writer, screenwriter and journalist who lives in Berlin and Istanbul.

What we know on day 1,407&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia launched waves of drones to attack the Black Sea ports of Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk with &lt;strong&gt;two civilian ships hit as they arrived to load wheat&lt;/strong&gt;, the Ukrainian navy and government officials said. The Panama-flagged civilian vessels Emmakris III and Captain Karam were struck, said the navy, adding that the attacks on Tuesday “&lt;strong&gt;threaten the lives of civilians and undermine global food security.&lt;/strong&gt; Targeted strikes on civilian objects are a deliberate war crime”. Ukraine is a major agricultural producer and exporter. Oil storage tanks were also hit, said Oleksiy Kuleba, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, who added that both ports continued to operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia’s continued and intensifying strikes on Ukraine are “an act of defiance” against the US plan to end the Ukraine war, a French presidential source said on Tuesday. Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;Moscow’s allegations of a Ukrainian drone attack against a residence of Vladimir Putin are not backed “by any solid proof&lt;/strong&gt;, including after cross-checking information with our partners”, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “Regarding the &lt;strong&gt;attack on [Putin’s residence at] Valdai&lt;/strong&gt;, our negotiating team connected with &lt;strong&gt;the American team, they went through the details, and we understand that it’s fake&lt;/strong&gt;. And, of course, our partners can always verify thanks to their technical capabilities that it was fake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Ukrainian drone attack damaged &lt;strong&gt;port infrastructure and a gas pipeline in Russia’s Black Sea port of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuapse&lt;/strong&gt;, the regional administration said on Wednesday, adding no injuries were reported. Tuapse and its refinery comprise one of Russia’s &lt;strong&gt;key Black Sea outlets for oil products that Ukraine targets because they are exported to finance the war or used directly to power the Russian military&lt;/strong&gt;. The port and refinery have been hit repeatedly by Ukrainian drone attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also launched drone attacks on Tuesday targeting &lt;strong&gt;Moscow, parts of western Russia and annexed Crimea&lt;/strong&gt;, injuring one person near the capital, Russian authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy said Ukraine would convene a &lt;strong&gt;meeting with leaders of Kyiv’s allies next Tuesday, 6 January, in France&lt;/strong&gt;, as diplomatic efforts to end the conflict intensified. The summit would be preceded by a &lt;strong&gt;meeting of their security advisers, planned for this Saturday, 3 January&lt;/strong&gt;, in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Germany accepted €10m to drop its investigation of the Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov for alleged EU sanctions violations&lt;/strong&gt;, prosecutors said on Tuesday. The agreement was made on the basis of the “presumption of innocence”, the prosecutors said. Usmanov is a close ally of Putin and head of the International Fencing Federation. He had been accused of using funds frozen under EU sanctions to pay for two properties in Germany to be monitored by a security company. In a separate investigation, prosecutors in Frankfurt had accused Usmanov of money laundering. That case was settled in November after Usmanov paid €4m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;US meanwhile removed sanctions from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexandra Buriko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, the former chief financial officer of Russia’s state-owned Sberbank&lt;/strong&gt;, according to a post on the US treasury department website. Buriko was among senior executives and directors who resigned from western-sanctioned Sberbank shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Buriko went to court in December 2024 seeking the sanctions’ removal, arguing she had severed ties with Sberbank. She and the US government were known to have been in negotiations to resolve the case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/31/ukraine-war-briefing-attack-on-global-food-security-as-russia-hits-wheat-ships-and-ports"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f4fdbd14d7c8fe74557a90767ad87e08f9b69a1/0_0_1804_1442/master/1804.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=63658329fc76c6dc05079b78ed939ad1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Three hikers found dead on southern California’s Mount Baldy</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/30/hikers-dead-southern-california-mount-baldy</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/30/hikers-dead-southern-california-mount-baldy</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 21:30:36 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;One person had made an emergency call after companion fell 500ft, but rescue copter couldn’t land due to high winds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man and two of his companions are dead after high winds prevented rescue crews from responding to a report of an injured hiker near a southern &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; mountain trail, the San Bernardino county sheriff’s department announced on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three bodies were discovered Monday evening along the Devil’s Backbone trail at Mount Baldy, which rises more than 10,000ft and sits just east of Los Angeles, according to a statement from the San Bernardino county sheriff’s department.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/30/hikers-dead-southern-california-mount-baldy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6987c2ba8e8c8878b40706bfc171f71b31d1d020/631_0_6310_5051/master/6310.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=40377306dbe4fd34b0353789f1d65378" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Minutes of latest Federal Reserve meeting reveal deep divide over interest rates</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/30/federal-reserve-minutes-interest-rate-monetary-policy</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/30/federal-reserve-minutes-interest-rate-monetary-policy</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 20:12:06 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In an unusual turn, the central bank’s board debated over monetary policy before the latest quarter-point cut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Federal Reserve agreed to cut interest rates at its December meeting only after a deeply nuanced debate about the risks facing the US economy right now, according to minutes of the latest two-day session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even some of those who supported the rate cut acknowledged “the decision was finely balanced or that they could have supported keeping the target range unchanged”, given the different risks facing the US economy, according to the minutes released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/30/federal-reserve-minutes-interest-rate-monetary-policy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c083efa1064155b91875003fb72973f509395a7f/210_0_2095_1677/master/2095.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7732783749a9c6eb54eb39185c0d305a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Trump’s shadow war in Venezuela grows, but country’s strongman leader still clings to power</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/military-drone-strike-venezuela-trump-maduro</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/military-drone-strike-venezuela-trump-maduro</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:34:22 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Report of a drone attack on a port facility signals new phase in US military campaign against Nicolás Maduro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/14/us-wargames-maduro-fall-venezuela"&gt;US wargames played out scenarios for Maduro’s fall.

Today, how US foreign policy has dramatically – and alarmingly – turned towards Latin America and the Caribbean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump is not generally noted as a student of history. Yet over the past year, his decisive reorientation of US foreign policy towards the Americas has revived a playbook dating back two centuries, to the fifth president, James Monroe. Now the 47th is doubling down. An anti-interventionist is having second thoughts. Remarks that sounded at first like bad jokes or random outbursts from the presidential id have become more sinister through repetition or accompanying actions. Only a fool would take all of Mr Trump’s comments literally – but they should certainly be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has refused to rule out using military force &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/04/trump-greenland-denmark-military-force"&gt;to take control of Greenland&lt;/a&gt; and repeatedly floated the idea of making Canada the 51st state. He threatened to seize the Panama canal. He has imposed swingeing tariffs on key partners, and says he might &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/business/economy/trump-north-american-trade-deal.html"&gt;abandon the Canada-Mexico trade &lt;/a&gt;pact signed in his first term.

 Kelley, who was appointed by the Democratic former president Joe Biden, issued the order after four migrants from South Sudan along with African Communities Together, a non-profit group, sued.

We had no plans, so we met at a local cinema and then wandered the long street between our houses, pausing for a drink or two in various bars and chatting to strangers doing the same. We stopped when we became hungry and shared a plate of curries and drank beer in the window of an Indian restaurant, watching the parade of partygoers outside. Then we walked to the top of the hill to watch the fireworks lighting up the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was after midnight as we strolled back but we weren’t quite ready to call it a night, and we found ourselves in a games arcade where a bunch of women were cramming into a photo booth to take a strip of black-and-white photos together. Their enthusiasm was infectious and so we waited until they were finished and did the same. I now have the strip of photos stuck on my fridge, secured under a magnet for a local plumber. In them, we are both grinning wildly at the camera, our faces squashed close, the years of friendship evident in our expressions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2025/dec/30/photo-booth-with-friends-magical"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d73abfcb50dae2b3c5a6702e609c84f7ae6ebbfa/3_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=3cb783bbd19c7d313732f2aac16d330a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Data is control’: what we learned from a year investigating the Israeli military’s ties to big tech</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/israeli-military-big-tech</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/israeli-military-big-tech</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:00:48 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an &lt;a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/press-gazette-events/british-journalism-awards-winners-2025-channel-4-news-and-cathy-newman-receive-top-prizes/"&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt; series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication &lt;a href="https://www.972mag.com/"&gt;+972 Magazine&lt;/a&gt; and the Hebrew-language outlet &lt;a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/"&gt;Local Call&lt;/a&gt; – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud"&gt;Microsoft’s cloud services&lt;/a&gt; – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians"&gt;cut off&lt;/a&gt; Israel’s access to some of its technology.

Seeing Netanyahu beg Donald Trump to be bailed out from a quagmire, a rising number of Americans openly acknowledge that Israel is not an ally but a liability. In September, the US’s Arab allies also reached the conclusion that we Iranians have always underscored: Israel’s recklessness is a threat to all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reality is paving the way for whole new relationships that may transform our region. The US administration now faces a dilemma: it can continue writing blank cheques for Israel with American taxpayer dollars and credibility, or be part of a tectonic change for the better. For decades, western policy towards our region has been mostly shaped by myths originating from Israel. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2025/jun/17/iran-israel-conflict-in-pictures"&gt;war in June&lt;/a&gt; was momentous for a number of reasons, including how it exposed the cost for the west of mistaking mythology for strategy. Israel and its proxies claim a “decisive victory”, with Iran left weakened and deterred. Yet our vast strategic depth – the country covers an area the size of western Europe, and has a population 10 times that of Israel’s – meant that most of our provinces were untouched by Israel’s aggression. In contrast, all Israelis experienced the might of our military. The narrative of invulnerability – central to Israel’s myth-making machine – has been shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seyed Abbas Araghchi is the Iranian foreign minister&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/30/iran-donald-trump-real-talks-both-win"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d552751945c3cbb808621b764b2c4d17d4a9653a/737_0_4029_3225/master/4029.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=dba1f6a18fabda37e6e83da2f027171e" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Trump should defy Netanyahu over nuclear talks with Iran, says its foreign minister</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/trump-should-defy-netanyahu-over-nuclear-talks-with-iran-says-its-foreign-minister</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/trump-should-defy-netanyahu-over-nuclear-talks-with-iran-says-its-foreign-minister</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:00:46 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Seyed Araghchi claims US president’s Arab allies now view Israel’s recklessness as ‘a threat to us all’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump should defy Benjamin Netanyahu and realise renewed talks with Iran over its nuclear programme are a better bet and more likely to succeed owing to stronger support in the region for a successful outcome, the Iranian foreign minister, Seyed Araghchi, says in a Guardian article.

Averse to unpleasant candor, the Democrats’ governing body functions more like a PR firm than a political organization devoted to grassroots capacities for winning elections. The party’s leaders pose as immune from critique, even if they have led the party to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unwilling to depart from the party establishment’s culture of conformity, the DNC has remained under the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5216615-can-the-democratic-party-free-itself-from-the-biden-brand/"&gt;Biden-Harris shadow&lt;/a&gt; throughout 2025. Release of an official autopsy might have shown that party leaders actually want to encourage public discourse about the missteps that enabled Donald Trump to become president again. But the DNC is proceeding as if there’s nothing to be learned from the tragic debacle of 2024 that its leaders don’t already know – and they don’t need to share their purported wisdom with anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voter &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;disenchantment:&lt;/strong&gt; Losing 6.8 million voters who supported Joe Biden in 2020 proved pivotal in the close 2024 election. Harris’s inability to mobilize those pro-Biden voters was a massive failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biden’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;betrayal:&lt;/strong&gt; Biden’s stubborn decision to seek re-election, and his refusal to step aside until very late in the process, robbed Democratic voters of open primaries and undermined Democrats’ chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abandoning the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;working-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;base:&lt;/strong&gt; With millions of Americans feeling desperate because of rising costs, the Harris campaign lost this Democratic base by bowing to corporate donors’ interests and failing to challenge the impact of corporate greed in escalating inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gaza &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Harris lost many voters – especially young people, Arab-Americans and Muslim Americans, with sizable consequences in Michigan and other swing states – due to her refusal to indicate any openness to shifting her policy position on Israel and Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;young &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;voters:&lt;/strong&gt; Extensive evidence shows a huge drop-off in Democratic support among young voters aged 18-29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

The rich and famous are being punished for their conspicuous vacuity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Katy Perry and five other women were launched into space in Jeff Bezos’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/27/blue-origin-all-woman-crew-flight"&gt;Blue Origin rocket&lt;/a&gt;, no doubt they expected to be celebrated as trailblazers. Cast your mind back to April, and the event was getting wall-to-wall &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2025/apr/14/katy-perry-lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-gayle-king-live-updates-news"&gt;news coverage&lt;/a&gt;. The crew, also including Bezos’s then-fiancee Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, were in space &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/14/blue-origin-rocket-launch"&gt;for about 11 minutes&lt;/a&gt;, during which Perry sang a rendition of Louis Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World and revealed the setlist for her Lifetimes tour. On their return, the pop star kissed the ground and showed a daisy to the camera – a tribute to her daughter, Daisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Well, talk about crashing back down to earth. Instead of being hailed as a giant leap for 21st-century feminism, the voyage turned into a colossal PR failure. It &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/15/lauren-sanchez-katy-perry-space-blue-origin-female-flight"&gt;was ridiculed&lt;/a&gt; for being tone-deaf, an out-of-touch luxury ride for the super-rich during a time of economic hardship. There were so many mocking memes and hot takes that Perry later &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/30/a-human-pinata-katy-perry-reflects-on-online-abuse-following-blue-origin-flight-and-latest-tour"&gt;admitted feeling “battered and bruised”&lt;/a&gt; at being turned into a “human piñata”. “I take it with grace and send them love,” she said, “cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for the unhinged and unhealed.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 But the Blue Origin backlash reflected a broader cultural shift. As the now-viral refrain from Kourtney Kardashian goes, “Kim, there’s people that are dying.” The public’s tolerance for the promotion of celebrity as an end in itself is disappearing fast. In a world beset by economic uncertainty, political upheaval, wars and environmental breakdown, is it any surprise we increasingly want to see those with big platforms use them for something more than self-promotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Of course, Jeff Bezos’s Venice wedding this summer, estimated to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/28/final-party-set-to-end-bezos-sanchez-wedding-extravaganza-in-venice"&gt;have cost £37m&lt;/a&gt;, was uber-glamorous, and any A-lister worth their buck was invited. We saw the photos of Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, Ivanka Trump and the Kardashians boarding water taxis to tour the Venetian lagoon. Once these images would have inspired envy or aspiration; now they arouse anger and feed “eat the rich” narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our celebrities were once distant figures whose lives functioned as escapism. Social media has eroded that distance, drawing stars into the same feeds, crises and conversations as everyone else. Now, when they appear indifferent, it reads as disdainful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadia Khomami is the arts and culture correspondent at the Guardian&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/30/2025-celebrities"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a9a68820014ece677a40dc0d91550e80aedf467/1_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1ebe6564d349c234bb37d15cd34a9de7" medium="image"/></item><item><title>What drove gen Z protests that brought down governments and called out corruption?

One resident of Gaza City describes the reality for Palestinians living with little shelter and no electricity or heating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was about 8.30pm on a Thursday when I headed back home in Gaza City. It was windy, and I couldn’t stay out any longer, so I had to walk. At first it was only a light drizzle, but after about 200 metres the rain suddenly grew heavier. That wasn’t surprising. I stopped near a tent to take shelter, rubbing my palms together to draw some warmth. A young boy was sitting outside selling homemade cookies. We exchanged a few words while I stood there, though he didn’t seem interested in talking. I noticed the cookies were loosely wrapped in plastic, already soggy from the drizzle, and I wondered if he’d have enough to sell before the night ended. The cold seeped into everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I walked along al-Wehda Street in Gaza City, tents lined both sides of the road. There were no voices coming from inside them, only the sound of rain pouring down and the whistle of the wind. As I hurried on, trying to dodge the rain, I switched on the torch of my mobile phone to see the road ahead. My thoughts kept returning to those sheltering inside: What are they doing now? What are they thinking? How do they feel? It was bitterly cold. I imagined children curled under wet blankets, parents shifting constantly to keep them warm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/30/shelter-storm-winter-weather-children-tents-christmas-in-gaza"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/717d85d35084e43aacf3e9f768ce4d63ee77a698/445_348_4635_3708/master/4635.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a927b456861332e61c6ea594122d2d0e" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Tuesday briefing: A surreal year in news gives our cartoonists endless material</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/first-edition-political-cartoons-of-2025</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/first-edition-political-cartoons-of-2025</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:45:01 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: Covering everything from Donald Trump to AI, and Gaza to Ukraine, award-winning cartoonist and illustrator Ben Jennings shares his favourite caricatures of 2025, and we share ours too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.

The last thing any stressed-out host wants to receive, in the moments before their big event begins, is a sudden flood of 11th-hour RSVPs from guests announcing that they’re not coming. And yet, as anyone who regularly organises large parties in Britain knows, that’s exactly what they tend to be sent. It needs to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an invitation turned down in advance stings a little, but it is genuinely helpful. It provides a sense of potential turnout to help gauge catering and expectations. A decline on the day, however, is infuriatingly useless. Food and booze will already long since have been ordered, and it’s way too late to invite another friend to make up the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phineas Harper is a writer and curator&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/30/hill-i-will-die-on-ghosting-party-invites-humane"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bddd8c9f915c050c5b07658dfffa432892591e9a/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=846f9e0e99cbdc129fd88095f3019fde" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Be fearful when others are greedy’: Warren Buffett’s sharpest lessons in investing</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/30/warren-buffett-retires-aunnual-letters-investing-lessons</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/30/warren-buffett-retires-aunnual-letters-investing-lessons</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:00:59 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/warren-buffett-retirement-berkshire-hathaway"&gt;who is retiring at the end of 2025&lt;/a&gt;, has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with $25m of shareholder equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than $1tn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex life. It’s not a push he needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attend &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; 100th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/30/warren-buffett-retires-aunnual-letters-investing-lessons"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d218a78e339c9698ddcbc45fd9e63371a830d6c/12_0_3805_3045/master/3805.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=35c0abf0ff7e94c42d80deab8cbe510c" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia bombs Yemen over weapons shipment it claims UAE sent to separatists</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/saudi-arabia-bombs-yemen-over-weapons-shipment-alleged-uae</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/saudi-arabia-bombs-yemen-over-weapons-shipment-alleged-uae</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:27:32 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Attack signals new escalation in tensions between the kingdom and the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia bombed Yemen’s port city of Mukalla on Tuesday over what it described as a shipment of weapons for a separatist force there that arrived from the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UAE did not immediately acknowledge the strike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/30/saudi-arabia-bombs-yemen-over-weapons-shipment-alleged-uae"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b1bba305cb02f04f50ee9c0e7c2c6b8c633575/207_0_2935_2347/master/2935.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=346d476f1646b0addeac442c3bd895a4" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The Louvre is the pride of France – and it’s on the verge of collapse.

At least France has woken up to its predicament &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before Versailles dazzled the world, the Louvre rose from the banks of the Seine as a royal residence. Charles V kept his &lt;a href="https://historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=273"&gt;celebrated library here&lt;/a&gt;; Henri IV installed his cabinets of paintings, objets d’art and arms, and created within its walls a veritable city of artists, where cabinetmakers, tapestry-makers, painters and armourers lived and worked. Under Louis XIII, coins, medals and the Louvre’s printing press were added; under Louis XIV came casts, antiquities and the academies of architecture, the arts and the sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Enlightenment demanded that the masterpieces of the art world be made public; the revolution answered. On 8 November 1793, ordinary citizens were admitted to the Louvre’s Salon Carré and Grande Galerie for the first time, transforming a royal palace into a national art museum. Continually evolving through redesign, reconstruction and reinvention, it has survived revolutions, arson and Nazi occupation. Within its labyrinthine galleries, audacious thefts have unfolded in broad daylight, while secret acts of bravery left barely a trace in history. The Louvre is a place of enduring mystery and fantasy, belonging to both France’s collective memory and the world’s imagination. This year, however, a succession of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/25/more-people-arrested-louvre-heist"&gt;thefts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/07/water-leak-in-the-louvre-damages-hundreds-of-works-museum-says"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt;

Zelenskyy says attack on Putin’s residence is ‘lies’. What we know on day 1,406&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine cannot win its war against Russia without US support and accused Moscow of trying to sabotage peace talks &lt;/strong&gt;after the Kremlin said it had foiled a Ukrainian drone attack on Vladimir Putin’s residence. Zelenskyy described the claim as “typical Russian lies” after his two-hour meeting on Sunday with Donald Trump in Florida, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/29/volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-us-security-guarantees-ukraine"&gt;Luke Harding and Sammy Gecsoyler report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian president said Russia was “at it again” and using “dangerous statements” to undermine “diplomatic efforts” with the US to end the conflict. He added: “This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy later said his Sunday meeting with Trump was productive&lt;/strong&gt;. “Can we win without American support? No,” Zelenskyy told Fox News, before laying out the difficulties that would be posed by a lack of US backing. He also said: “I don’t trust Putin and he doesn’t want success for Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin has told his army to press on with a campaign to take full control of the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt; after a Russian commander said Moscow’s forces were 15km (9.3 miles) from its biggest city. Col-Gen Mikhail Teplinsky told the Russian president at a televised meeting with top military officials at the Kremlin on Monday – a day after Putin spoke with Trump about Ukraine – that Russian forces were getting closer to the city of Zaporizhzhia. Moscow controls about 75% of Ukraine’s wider Zaporizhzhia province, one of four Putin annexed in 2022 in a move denounced by Kyiv and the west as illegal. Gen Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia’s general staff, earlier told Putin that Moscow’s forces were advancing along nearly the entire frontline, while Kyiv’s forces were focused on defence and attempting to counterattack. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia’s foreign minister said the west must understand that Russia holds the strategic initiative in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt; as discussions move forward on a possible settlement. Sergei Lavrov told state news agency RIA that Kyiv and western countries had to come to terms with the fact that Russia held the initiative on the battlefield as the fourth anniversary of its 2022 invasion approaches. “Our principled position remains unchanged. The strategic initiative rests wholly with the Russian army and the west understands this.” Ukraine and the west, Lavrov said, had to take account of the realities on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power line repairs near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have been successfully completed&lt;/strong&gt;, the International Atomic Energy Agency cited its director general, Rafael Grossi, as saying on Monday. An IAEA team was monitoring repairs near the plant after a local ceasefire brokered by the agency began, with the work expected to last several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A historic theatre in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/25/mariupol-bombed-theatre-reopen-russification-ukraine"&gt;has opened its doors&lt;/a&gt; more than three years after it was destroyed in a Russian airstrike that killed hundreds of civilians sheltering inside&lt;/strong&gt;. Moscow-installed authorities marked the rebuilding of the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theatre with a gala concert on the building’s new main stage Sunday night. The original theatre was destroyed when it was targeted by a Russian airstrike in 2022 as Moscow’s forces besieged the city.

To this end, next year has been decreed the &lt;a href="https://goallin.org.uk/"&gt;National Year of Reading 2026&lt;/a&gt;. It couldn’t be more timely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading is in crisis. Picking up a book for pleasure among children and young people in the UK is at its lowest level in 20 years. According to the &lt;a href="https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/children-and-young-peoples-reading-in-2025/"&gt;National Literacy Trust&lt;/a&gt;, only one in three eight- to 18-year‑olds enjoy reading in their spare time – a 36% drop in two decades.

The golden age of discovery is over and the way we develop and use drugs needs to change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her tenure as director general of the World Health Organization, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/former-directors-general"&gt;Dr Margaret Chan&lt;/a&gt; used to say that all&amp;nbsp;of the “&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Superbugs/3yxQDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=Superbugs:+An+Arms+Race+Against+Bacteria+all+of+the+%27easy%27+antibiotics+have+already+been+discovered&amp;amp;pg=PT53&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt;” antibiotics had already been found. Her point was that in responding to the urgent&amp;nbsp;threat of antibiotic-resistant infections, we would struggle to&amp;nbsp;find new medicines – or preserve the ones we have – if we didn’t find new ways of working. She was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, just 16 antibiotics have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12561554/"&gt;gained widespread regulatory approval&lt;/a&gt; – mostly close relatives of medicines already in use and so unlikely&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;evade resistance for long. The development&amp;nbsp;of new ones is a slow and unprofitable business, curative medicines being less lucrative than ones treating longer-term conditions. And the scientific outlook remains bleak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I think it’s more likely that when the AI bubble bursts, the creators of the crisis, along with other wealthy economic actors, will be in the rooms with the politicians telling them how to “rescue” us all by transferring wealth in some way from average citizens to the already extremely wealthy. Just like they did during the financial crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to be ready with alternative plans. For example, world governments could coordinate to buy, for suitably low prices, majority shares in any crashing tech company that actually produces something useful, ensuring that those shares come with full voting rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/29/we-must-take-control-of-ai-now-before-its-too-late"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b23b6af7acdbb34944ec571e381c47905a493662/1000_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0d3df465c437219fe68eb94dd238bce5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>US struck ‘big facility’ in Venezuela, Trump claimed without offering details</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/29/trump-venezuela-facility-strike</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/29/trump-venezuela-facility-strike</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:30:03 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Trump alleged that US forces hit ‘very hard’ in what would mark his team’s first land strike on Venezuela if confirmed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; has claimed that US forces struck a “big facility” in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; last week – but the president did not specify what it was, or where, and the White House has not commented further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just knocked out – I don’t know if you read or you saw – they have a big plant, or a big facility, where the ships come from.

The last few months of the year have seen &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/crypto-selloff/story?id=127819101"&gt;$1tn in value&lt;/a&gt; wiped from the digital asset market, despite bitcoin hitting an all-time-high price of &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bitcoin-hits-all-time-high-above-125000-2025-10-05/"&gt;$126,000&lt;/a&gt; on 6 October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The October price peak was short-lived. Bitcoin’s price tumbled just days later after Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent shockwaves across the market on 12 October.

They only knew the Reiners by their work, but they feel a connection: Grover’s son also became addicted at 15 to opioids and then heroin, much like Nick Reiner, and he was in and out of rehab and jail for years.

The expectation was that, as the new duties drove up prices of consumer goods and inputs – affecting households and companies, respectively – surging inflation and falling real incomes would follow. This would be a supply shock, so the US Federal Reserve could not do much to counteract it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump did raise tariffs to shocking levels, violating &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250318_Trump-and-the-World-Economy.pdf?x85095"&gt;international&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9ggbn0dgp37jkknk0rxpu/2025-05-13-Jeffrey-Frankel-Taking-a-Sledgehammer-to-US-Global-Leadership-Trump-s-Tariffs.mp4?rlkey=9iw66ek8uh5kyqwnf59ptt6qr&amp;amp;e=2&amp;amp;st=s51qydmr&amp;amp;dl=0ido"&gt;agreements&lt;/a&gt; and blowing up the Republican party’s &lt;a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/blogs-and-reviews/protectionism-nothing-new-republicans"&gt;oft-professed&lt;/a&gt; commitment to free trade. In terms of severity and disruptiveness, Trump’s 2025 tariffs went far beyond the already harmful tariffs of his &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-china-trump-tariffs-economic-cost-by-jeffrey-frankel-2019-05"&gt;first term&lt;/a&gt;, and even beyond the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Passes_Smoot_Hawley_Tariff.htm"&gt;Smoot-Hawley Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1930. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the &lt;a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-26-2025"&gt;average effective tariff&lt;/a&gt; on US imports rose from &lt;a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/"&gt;2% to 18%&lt;/a&gt;, the highest level since the 1930s, this year.

Both times it left me feeling a bit queasy. Bevan is a mighty working-class hero. Probably no other minister, even in that 1945 government of heroes, would have had the vision, the muscle or the sheer energy to make a national health service happen at all in those bleak postwar years, let alone in a way that no incoming government could unpick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS sits at the heart of politics and for most of my career in journalism, and charting the crises, the numbers, the arguments, the possibilities and the costs was a staple of my work. You can write all that, you can read about all that, but it can feel very different when events dictate that you cross the line from commentator to patient; when, like me, you pitch up as someone who arrives as an emergency, with a condition that might require major surgery and at least a week of post-operative hospital care – or might just go away of its own accord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Perkins is a writer and broadcaster, and a former Guardian correspondent&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/29/nhs-challenges-flaws-patient-love-magic"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66b890d1cf7b19159f9fe5cd2de0afb608cc3fe4/1168_177_5905_4723/master/5905.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=09234c859d6d7cc7107fced32211b5d5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Queensland to continue to allow farmers to shoot flying foxes after revoking ban on controversial practice</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/30/queensland-to-continue-to-allow-farmers-to-shoot-flying-foxes-after-revoking-ban-on-controversial-practice</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/30/queensland-to-continue-to-allow-farmers-to-shoot-flying-foxes-after-revoking-ban-on-controversial-practice</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:00:43 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Conservationists and scientists criticise state for backtracking and say alternative non-lethal methods such as netting are more effective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get our &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;breaking news email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3"&gt;free app&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;daily news podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Queensland government has backtracked on plans to end the shooting of flying foxes from July 2026, continuing a practice wildlife advocates and scientists describe as “ineffective” and “inhumane”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permits issued by the state’s environment department allow Queensland farmers to shoot flying foxes for the purposes of crop protection, up to an annual statewide quota set at 1,630 animals.

It defines a nation and its culture – and we must defend it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Hall was director general of the BBC between April 2013 and August 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t let President Trump cloud the real debate about the BBC. Of course, his demand for damages of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvd81470v1o"&gt;no less than $5bn&lt;/a&gt; has dominated our thinking about the corporation over the past few weeks, as has its cause. But let’s get this into perspective. This was a serious own goal and journalists make mistakes. Salvation in this case would have been a line of script between the clips, or once a mistake had been discovered, a very speedy public acknowledgment. Now, though, the BBC is right not to yield on this. It has apologised. And, unlike other broadcasters and institutions in the United States, it doesn’t need the president’s support. This is a chance to demonstrate the BBC’s independence. Fight on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we must not let this cloud the debate here about the sort of BBC we all want and need, and I hope that is what dominates our conversation in the coming crucial year. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/britains-story-the-next-chapter-the-bbc-royal-charter-review-green-paper-and-public-consultation"&gt;government’s green paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in December, starts off with a reminder of what, despite all its travails, the BBC delivers for the country. “It’s not just a broadcaster,” says the introduction, “it’s also a national institution … if it did not already exist, we would have to invent it.” The secretary of state, Lisa Nandy, is even more forthright: “I believe the BBC, alongside the NHS, is one of the two most important institutions in our country. While one is fundamental to the health of our people, the other is fundamental to the health of our democracy.” Seeing the BBC not just as a media organisation, but as a cultural organisation helping to define who we are is crucial to next year’s debate about what we want the BBC to be. It should be seen as part of our social infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/29/bbc-story-britain-netflix-streaming-channels-nation"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb6f5a806bed7bb21178c7a7a3f89800308a02f/682_99_2720_2177/master/2720.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1596392f409a35400319a4814ac92122" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘They want to destroy my career’: Kiwi Chow on life as a dissenting director in Hong Kong</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/29/kiwi-chow-dissenting-director-deadline-hong-kong</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/29/kiwi-chow-dissenting-director-deadline-hong-kong</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 06:00:30 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;With his new film rejected by official censors, the award-winning film-maker says he is being punished for his outspoken views&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hong Kong, where &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/08/hong-kong-election-low-turnout-discontent-apartment-fire"&gt;dissent is now characterised by silence&lt;/a&gt;, few dare openly criticise the government or the Chinese Communist party (CCP) that controls it.

But poverty and precarity are forcing vast numbers to emigrate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the gardens of Rome’s Castel Sant’Angelo were filled with families enjoying some unseasonably warm sun by a pop-up ice rink. Teenage couples skated hand in hand, while the watching crowds sipped mulled wine and hot chocolate to a soundtrack of Nat King Cole. At first glance, it &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/giorgia-meloni-atreju-brothers-of-italy-far-right"&gt;looked like a normal Christmas market&lt;/a&gt;. The stands, however, revealed a different reality. Among the nativity displays and kitsch decorations were adverts for nationalist newspapers and something called “patriot radio”. On a wall near the kids’ play area, a mural depicted an unlikely cast of characters, tracing a lineage from the fascist poet Gabriele D’Annunzio to the late American Maga influencer Charlie Kirk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the setup I witnessed at this year’s Atreju, Italy’s biggest rightwing festival, which has been running since 1998 as an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/giorgia-meloni-atreju-brothers-of-italy-far-right"&gt;annual celebration of patriotism&lt;/a&gt; and nationalism. During the early editions, proud neo-fascists, including black-hooded thugs from street movements such as CasaPound and Forza Nuova, made up a visible portion of the attenders. At this year’s event, however, the Celtic crosses and odal rune tattoos were tucked under well-ironed shirts. The crowd was made up of nerdy students, gen-Z influencers, civil society campaigners and passersby who had been lured off the street by the glittery lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Mackay is a writer and translator based in Florence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/29/italy-far-right-atreju-festival-giorgia-meloni"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19fbaa01a97ea47b3ed896449086e941592cb095/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=445701114aee35804ba4e467e99d6bb1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 expected to resume on Tuesday</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/29/search-for-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-expected-to-resume</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/29/search-for-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-expected-to-resume</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:30 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Marine robotics firm to renew its search more than decade after plane disappeared with 239 people onboard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is expected to resume on 30 December, more than a decade after the plane disappeared with 239 people onboard in one of&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/06/mh370-anniversary-10-years-malaysia-airlines-flight-plane-search-mystery-unsolved"&gt; aviation’s greatest mysteries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A renewed search by Ocean Infinity, a UK and US-based marine robotics company, had begun earlier this year but was called off in April because of bad weather.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/29/search-for-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-expected-to-resume"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c90c3e2b0edf0006d812db67f98a3fdbe4df03/513_0_3618_2894/master/3618.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8c8170635525f3b753559841a45d8396" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The mystery of flight MH370: will a new search find the missing airliner after more than a decade?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/29/malaysian-airlines-flight-mh370-mystery-search-indian-ocean-infinity-robots</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/29/malaysian-airlines-flight-mh370-mystery-search-indian-ocean-infinity-robots</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:30 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014 the Malaysian Airlines jet vanished over the Indian Ocean.

Trump says it will be clear in ‘a few weeks’ if negotiations can succeed. What we know on day 1,405&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/28/trump-zelenskyy-talks-amid-heavy-russian-airstrikes-on-ukraine"&gt;“getting a lot closer, maybe very close”&lt;/a&gt; to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, though both leaders acknowledged that some of the thorniest details remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump said it will be clear “in a few weeks” whether negotiations to end the war will succeed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy said an agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine has been reached. Trump was slightly more cautious&lt;/strong&gt;, saying that they were 95% of the way to such an agreement, and that he expected European countries to “take over a big part” of that effort with US backing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy said on Monday he and Trump made significant progress in talks and agreed that US and Ukrainian teams would meet next week&lt;/strong&gt; to finalise issues aimed at ending Russia’s war in Ukraine. “We had a substantive conversation on all issues and highly value the progress that the Ukrainian and American teams have made over the past weeks,” Zelenskiy said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both Trump and Zelenskyy said the future of the Donbas had not been settled.&lt;/strong&gt; “It’s unresolved, but it’s getting a lot closer. That’s a very tough issue,” Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The head of the EU commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, was on a call with European leaders and Trump and Zelenskyy. She said progress was “good”&lt;/strong&gt; and that Europe was ready to build on the steps taken in Florida. She stressed that more important than anything else would be “ironclad security guarantees from day one” for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;British PM Keir Starmer was also on the call.&lt;/strong&gt; A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The discussion focused on ongoing efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, with leaders commending President Trump for the progress achieved so far. They underlined the importance of robust security guarantees and reaffirmed the urgency of ending this barbaric war as soon as possible.

Today we look skyward, where a new lunar contest mirrors humanity’s struggle to live within planetary limits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the cold war’s space race, the Apollo moon missions were driven by the need to prove American superiority. Having made that political and technological point with the 1969 moon landing, the contest between Moscow and Washington petered out. A new dash across the skies kicks off in &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cxwwjlrk1mlo"&gt;2026&lt;/a&gt;, reigniting geopolitical competition under the guise of “&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-accords/"&gt;peaceful exploration&lt;/a&gt;”. The moon’s south pole is emerging as the most valuable &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1512196/the-peaks-of-eternal-light-are-the-most-valuable-real-estate-on-the-moon"&gt;real estate &lt;/a&gt;in the solar system, offering “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_of_eternal_light"&gt;peaks of eternal light&lt;/a&gt;” for solar arrays and&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/08/space-water-ice-moon-south-pole/"&gt; ice deposits&lt;/a&gt; in craters shielded from&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US and a China-led bloc are eyeing the lunar surface and its potential to control a post-terrestrial economy. Space had been humanity’s last commons, supposedly shielded by the 1967 UN outer space treaty that bans state exploitation of the heavens. It is vague, however, on private claims – a loophole that is now fuelling a tycoon-led scramble for the stars. The aim is obvious: to act first, shape norms and dare others to object. Two lunar missions launching next year– Nasa’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/science/first-us-artemis-astronaut-mission-around-moon-track-april-officials-say-2025-09-23/"&gt;Artemis II&lt;/a&gt;

The rationale behind them has been widely opposed, but the strikes themselves have been welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airstrikes were framed as a response to what have been described as genocidal &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-launches-strikes-on-isis-targets-in-nigeria-trump-says/"&gt;attacks on Christians&lt;/a&gt; in the country. But the Nigerian authorities have consistently &lt;a href="https://guardian.ng/news/nigerian-officials-reject-christian-genocide-claims-in-talks-with-us-congressman/"&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; this narrative, arguing that armed groups in the country do not discriminate based on religion, and that Christians and Muslims largely coexist peacefully. Ironically, it was Trump’s redesignation of Nigeria as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/01/trump-nigeria-christian-persecution"&gt;country of particular concern&lt;/a&gt;” in November that deepened Muslim-Christian tensions.

In that case, read on. In November, I was on a train travelling into London. When I got off the train and headed for the ticket barrier, I realised I didn’t have my wallet. I knew that I had had it when I boarded. I made an undignified scrabble and search through my coat, jacket and trouser pockets that deserved the comic skills of a Charlie Chaplin or Jacques Tati. There was, though, no mistake. I had somehow managed to leave my wallet on the train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nice station attendant took the details and said he would pass the message down the line. I left him my mobile number. But it was rush hour, the man pointed out, and the chances of getting the wallet back had probably vanished with the departing train. Meanwhile I rang my bank and eventually succeeded in cancelling my cards. I felt horribly stupid, old and embarrassed. I went for a drink with friends and felt sorry for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/28/need-cheering-up-after-a-terrible-year-i-may-have-just-the-story-youre-looking-for"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fef56a1f5229c471eb5d974ed60ebd990fe61e82/2_0_2437_1949/master/2437.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f27b689d6c954ba834095d04179464f8" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Almost collapsed’: behind the Korean film crisis and why K-pop isn’t immune</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/28/behind-crisis-korean-film-why-k-pop-isnt-immune</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/28/behind-crisis-korean-film-why-k-pop-isnt-immune</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 08:00:03 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Both industries dominate the world but now face fundamental transformation and uncertainty at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s entertainment dominance appears unshakeable.

It’s lonely being the only person who cares about something. It’s even lonelier when the thing you care about makes you want to stamp your feet, tear your hair out and run naked into the streets while making the face of Edvard Munch’s The Scream. And so it is for me whenever I see a film poster, headline, book cover or screen caption featuring the incorrect use of the Cyrillic alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think this is a niche preoccupation. But you would be surprised how many times the name of “STДLIN” pops up in poster designs, supposedly representing “STALIN”. This phenomenon annoys me most when the entity depicted is not fictional. If you write the (nonexistent-in-any-language) word “STДLIN” instead of “STALIN” you are writing “STDLIN”. Which would be fine if you were attempting some kind of wordplay comparing the impact of the one-time Soviet leader to a sexually transmitted disease. But clever wordplay is not the intention of these designs. The intention of the incorrect use of the Cyrillic alphabet is to indicate one thing and one thing alone: “This is about something that is happening east of Warsaw! It is probably connected to the former Soviet Union! It should give you a frisson of creepy exoticism!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viv Groskop is a comedian and author of &lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/one-ukrainian-summer-9781804184950/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article"&gt;One Ukrainian Summer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/28/the-hill-i-will-die-on-faux-cyrillic"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fbf977847b2df41ebb3d31d5c9469e55b574b37/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=35e7f08988cf19eea3202008b7601200" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Australian cruise ship investigated after leaving passenger behind runs aground off PNG with 120 people on board</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/28/australian-cruise-ship-investigated-after-leaving-passenger-behind-runs-aground-off-png-with-120-people-on-board</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/28/australian-cruise-ship-investigated-after-leaving-passenger-behind-runs-aground-off-png-with-120-people-on-board</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 05:31:47 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Coral Adventurer says passengers and crew are safe while team tries to refloat ship and inspects the hull&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get our &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;breaking news email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3"&gt;free app&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;daily news podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Australian cruise ship being investigated after allegedly leaving behind a passenger who died alone has run aground off the coast of Papua New Guinea with more than 120 people aboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coral Adventurer ran aground early on Saturday morning, about 30km from PNG’s second-largest city, Lae.

What we know on day 1,404&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies Nabu and Sapo raided national parliament offices&lt;/strong&gt; in Kyiv on Saturday as investigators alleged some MPs were implicated in a new graft probe. A statement from Nabu, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, accused State Security Department guards of “resisting Nabu officers during investigative actions in committees of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine”. The anti-corruption agency did not reveal details of the investigation, but said suspects took bribes for votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine’s State Security Department said the anti-corruption detectives were stopped at first by security but later allowed in.&lt;/strong&gt; An &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/28/ukraines-anti-corruption-agencies-search-home-zelenskyy-chief-aide-andriy-yermak"&gt;earlier corruption investigation&lt;/a&gt; has led to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/28/ukraine-corruption-scandal-threatens-zelenskyy-special-relationship-with-top-aide"&gt;resignation of the chief of staff&lt;/a&gt; to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It involved an alleged $100m kickback scheme in the battered energy sector, allegedly masterminded by a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/ukraine-energy-sector-corruption-crisis"&gt;personal friend of the president&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy said he would hold talks with European leaders&lt;/strong&gt; after meeting Donald Trump on Sunday. The Ukrainian president said he had spoken with a group of &lt;strong&gt;Ukraine’s partners to coordinate priorities on the diplomatic track&lt;/strong&gt;. “Tomorrow, after the meeting with President Trump, we will continue the discussion.” &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/zelenskyy-to-meet-trump-in-coming-days-as-us-steps-up-push-for-ukraine-peace-deal"&gt;The Ukrainian leader has headed to Florida&lt;/a&gt; for the Trump meeting. Zelenskyy stopped in Canada, where he met the prime minister, Mark Carney, who announced an &lt;strong&gt;additional $2.5bn (£1.85bn) of economic aid for Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the Florida meeting, and amid pressure from the Trump administration for Ukraine to concede territory for peace, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed that Russia is demanding such concessions because it &lt;strong&gt;“does not have sufficient manpower or materiel” to take the rest of the Donetsk region&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;while continuing its war in other parts of Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; “The Kremlin is therefore making demands in negotiations that Ukraine cede the unoccupied parts of Donetsk oblast,” the ISW assessed, “… possibly to put Russia in a more advantageous position to re-invade in the future to pursue Putin’s longer-term strategic goal of controlling all of Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin’s commanders are sending false reports up the chain of command&lt;/strong&gt;, contributing to Ukrainian gains on the battlefield, according to complaints from Russian milbloggers as reported by the ISW, which said: “Ukrainian forces continue to make &lt;a href="https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-december-26-2025/"&gt;tactical gains in Kupiansk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Russian milbloggers are increasingly acknowledging Ukrainian successes&lt;/strong&gt;. The scale of Russian milblogger complaints about Kupiansk … demonstrates the scale and egregiousness of the Russian military command’s lies about Kupiansk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis came as Russia claimed to have captured two more towns in eastern Ukraine: Myrnohrad and Huliaipole, near Pokrovsk which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/24/ukraine-best-hope-russia-inches-forward-on-battlefield"&gt;Russia claims also to have captured but is still contested&lt;/a&gt;.

 The Treasury will insure the 70-metre embroidered cloth, which depicts the 1066 Norman invasion and Battle of Hastings, for damage or loss during its transfer from France and while it is on display at the British Museum from September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 It will back the cover under the Government Indemnity Scheme, an alternative to commercial insurance that allows art and cultural objects to be shown in the UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 The Financial Times reported the Treasury had provisionally approved an estimated valuation for the tapestry with the final valuation expected to be about £800m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An HM Treasury spokesperson said: “The Government Indemnity Scheme is a longstanding scheme that allows museums and galleries to borrow high value works for major exhibitions, increasing visitor numbers and providing public benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 “Without this cover, public museums and galleries would face a substantial commercial insurance premium, which would be significantly less cost effective.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/27/bayeux-tapestry-to-be-insured-for-800m-for-british-museum-exhibition"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff117fedf313f47fe8c21ad4e2f8d1fe2ab6b7e/1050_74_3174_2541/master/3174.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8584d9009c3297ef639fdda034ca3c6a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>In the battle against antisemitism we must accept that Zionism means different things to different people | David Slucki</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/28/what-does-zionism-mean-different-things-people-antisemitism-ntwnfb</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/28/what-does-zionism-mean-different-things-people-antisemitism-ntwnfb</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 19:00:47 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Among Jews the meaning of the term has evolved – but there is still no consensus.

In response, the New South Wales government announced measures to further curb hate speech and symbols, and, more controversially, new protest powers. This event and the government’s response have once again raised questions about the relationship between Jews, Israel, Zionism and anti-Zionism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zionism is a Jewish national movement that sought to create a Jewish state, then to secure and sustain it. But “Zionism” is also a contested label: for many Jews it signifies safety, continuity and belonging; for Palestinians – and for many others – it denotes dispossession and ongoing domination. It’s clear that for different people, the word Zionism means very different things, which leads to people talking past one another – with real-world consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/28/what-does-zionism-mean-different-things-people-antisemitism-ntwnfb"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be8fcd18dd6b6b8eeb9148a9b4c9fe9ecc372647/1593_273_4934_3949/master/4934.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=63c0d192b950436f45237721f269ec7c" medium="image"/></item><item><title>More than 20% of videos shown to new YouTube users are ‘AI slop’, study finds</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/27/more-than-20-of-videos-shown-to-new-youtube-users-are-ai-slop-study-finds</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/27/more-than-20-of-videos-shown-to-new-youtube-users-are-ai-slop-study-finds</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:00:43 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Low-quality AI-generated content is now saturating social media – and generating about $117m a year, data shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 20% of the videos that YouTube’s algorithm shows to new users are “AI slop” – low-quality AI-generated content designed to farm views, &lt;a href="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/ai-slop-report-the-global-rise-of-low-quality-ai-videos/"&gt;research has found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video-editing company Kapwing surveyed 15,000 of the world’s most popular YouTube channels – the top 100 in every country – and found that 278 of them contain only &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/06/ai-research-papers"&gt;AI slop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/27/more-than-20-of-videos-shown-to-new-youtube-users-are-ai-slop-study-finds"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d8021bb048378298f4bb9ca81867e7248b5a3cd/0_1_5000_3998/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=52cf2c74b6eeab87dcb06599f36d7729" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Poland preparing €2bn anti-drone fortifications along its eastern border amid Russian threat</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/27/poland-anti-drone-fortifications-eastern-borders-cezary-tomczyk</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/27/poland-anti-drone-fortifications-eastern-borders-cezary-tomczyk</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 15:55:41 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Deputy defence minister says new air defence systems will be completed in 24 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland plans to complete a new set of anti-drone fortifications along its eastern borders within two years, a top defence official has said, after a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/poland-shoots-down-drones-over-its-territory-amid-russian-attack-on-ukraine-says-military"&gt;massive incursion&lt;/a&gt; of unmanned Russian aerial combat vehicles into Polish airspace earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expect to have the first capabilities of the system in roughly six months, perhaps even sooner.

It’s a typical self-empowerment manual in which the pair expound on the secrets of entrepreneurial success while drawing on their personal experiences. At one point, &lt;a href="http://digitallibrary.loyolacollegekerala.edu.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/2104/1/Midas%20Touch_%20Why%20Some%20Entrepreneurs%20Get%20Rich-And%20Why%20Most%20Don_t.pdf"&gt;they write&lt;/a&gt;, “Building a brand may be more important than building a business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was certainly Trump’s approach to business: he was the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; real estate tycoon who turned his fame into a brand that symbolized luxury and savvy strategy – even if his companies had filed for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/"&gt;bankruptcy six times&lt;/a&gt;. Trump spent decades trying to use his name to turn a profit: he owned an airline and a university, and slapped his moniker on vodka, steaks, neckties, board games and even bottled water. Leveraging the fame he gained from the Apprentice TV show, he expanded to licensing Trump-branded global real estate projects built by other developers. In many of these ventures, Trump collected licensing fees, rather than investing his own money, ensuring that he profited even if the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-s-failed-business-ventures-are-back-spotlight-n531906"&gt;businesses collapsed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/27/trump-is-shamelessly-covering-america-in-his-name"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1dd84286b935893ea220ef6408a6307a667c0d7/321_0_3212_2571/master/3212.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=148c5e5358a66fe54f221a5762f8afaf" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Winter weather disrupts air traffic in New Jersey and New York</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/27/new-york-new-jersey-snow-weather-emergencies</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/27/new-york-new-jersey-snow-weather-emergencies</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 15:46:10 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly 15,000 flights were canceled or delayed as both states declared weather emergencies after snowstorm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mix of snow and ice bore down on the US north-east early on Saturday, disrupting post-holiday weekend airline traffic and prompting officials in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; to issue weather emergency declarations even as the storm ebbed by mid-morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 14,400 domestic US flights on Saturday were canceled or delayed as of mid-morning, with the majority in the New York area, including at John F Kennedy international airport, LaGuardia airport and Newark Liberty international airport, according to the tracking site FlightAware.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/27/new-york-new-jersey-snow-weather-emergencies"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/509f1a16f59a42284acc5d22ddb30b7f89db08f4/12_0_4460_3570/master/4460.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=776a88d9a73abc2741285bfff709527f" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Southern California cleans up after the wettest Christmas season in recent history</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/27/southern-california-cleans-up-after-the-wettest-christmas-season-in-recent-history</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/27/southern-california-cleans-up-after-the-wettest-christmas-season-in-recent-history</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 15:48:42 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;More than 17in of rain fell in Ventura county, with trees knocked down and hundreds of car crashes throughout region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southern Californians are facing an epic clean-up operation after the region’s wettest &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; holiday in recent history turned areas of the state into a panorama of mud and debris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, record wildfires scorched the dry neighborhoods of Altadena and Pacific Palisades.

In January, recording his podcast in a studio in Austin, Texas, the host, Joe Rogan, and the actor Mel Gibson &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rYtrS5IbrQ"&gt;merrily dissed climate science&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, about 1,200 miles away in California, Gibson’s $14m &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/mel-gibson-wildfires-malibu-house-burned-down-joe-rogan-1236106022/"&gt;home was being incinerated&lt;/a&gt; in the Palisades wildfire. In this and other respects, their discussion could be seen as prefiguring the entire 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of his house hadn’t been confirmed at the time of the interview, but Gibson said his son had just sent him “a video of my neighbourhood, and it’s in flames. It looks like an inferno.” According to World Weather Attribution, January’s fires in California were made &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-increased-the-likelihood-of-wildfire-disaster-in-highly-exposed-los-angeles-area/"&gt;significantly more likely&lt;/a&gt; by climate breakdown. Factors such as the extreme lack of rainfall and stronger winds made such fires both more likely to happen and more intense than they would have been without human-caused global heating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/27/mel-gibson-denies-climate-breakdown-home-burns-joe-rogan"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4a5b8beb69b7cf9821d10f938775d1d410b72b/44_0_6573_5260/master/6573.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=95d303f45793427b55b21cbb894a2ddf" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Ghost resorts’: as hundreds of ski slopes lie abandoned, will nature reclaim the Alps?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/27/alps-france-skiing-snow-warming-resorts-closing-ceuze-landscape</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/27/alps-france-skiing-snow-warming-resorts-closing-ceuze-landscape</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:48:56 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;With the snow line edging higher, 186 French ski resorts have shut, while global heating threatens dozens more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Céüze 2000 ski resort closed at the end of the season in 2018, the workers assumed they would be back the following winter.

The law protecting wildlife is outdated and, as recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/commentary-and-opinion/the-uks-animal-welfare-laws-look-impressive-until-you-ask-who-enforces-them/5125439.article"&gt;Law Society&lt;/a&gt;, is ripe for review. Why, for example, have comprehensive protection for four of our native mustelids and almost nothing for the remaining two? Further, the recent &lt;a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/22"&gt;Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act&lt;/a&gt; requires the government to consider sentience when framing policy. Against this background, one would have thought a review of outdated wildlife legislation&amp;nbsp;would be a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the edges are tinkered with yet again. The government’s strategy includes a proposal for a close season for hares. It is claimed that fewer young hares will be left vulnerable to starvation and predation.

That’s not the world I choose to live in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sparrows are a shuffling, chirruping shadow in the bushes, a static of anticipation. They are waiting for food, calling for it. They have not forgotten what the poet Emily Dickinson describes, in her poem &lt;a href="https://allpoetry.com/Victory-comes-late,"&gt;Victory Comes Late&lt;/a&gt;, as “God keeps his oath to sparrows, / Who of little love / Know how to starve!” However, sparrows do seem to live in a much more vivid and emotional society than as mere victims of an indifferent nature that is economical at the expense of&amp;nbsp;compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To say they come to the feeding station sounds a bit grand for a small bird table, a few hanging fat balls and a scattering of seed and mealworms in a back yard in Oswestry. The first adventurers edge in, not just to explore the food source but to play in a space of subtle changes that have happened in their place. When the whole &lt;a href="https://birdspot.co.uk/culture/collective-nouns-for-birds"&gt;host, quarrel or ubiquity&lt;/a&gt; move in, there must be over 30 birds.

Payne died at the age of 73 in October 1917 and was buried in the Norfolk town of North Walsham, along with his wife Eleanor and son James Edward, who was killed in the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917. “Not lost”, reads the simple slab, “but gone before”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is far from the first Norfolk gravestone Cocker, 53, has photographed – in fact, over 24 years, she has captured almost half a million of them, driving around the county on her weekends and days off from her job in the local Lidl supermarket. As a result, she has produced a remarkable dataset of 615,000 names – many graves contain more than one person – which experts consider one of the most comprehensive photographic records of gravestones and memorials in England.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/26/hidden-engine-room-amateur-historians-genealogical-research"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e328048d2bb584cd48aff3f6a1a47c07b0e5476/808_0_6756_5405/master/6756.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8c4c00f318de162b473306e80ce7356a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Japan’s cabinet approves record defence budget amid escalating China tensions</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/japan-defence-budget-china</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/japan-defence-budget-china</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 06:16:07 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Japanese strike-back capabilities and coastal defences to be boosted while Beijing accuses Tokyo of fuelling a ‘space arms race’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s cabinet has approved a record high defence budget as tensions with China continue to spiral, with Beijing this week accusing Tokyo of “fuelling a space arms race”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft defence budget for the next fiscal year – approved on Friday – is more than ¥9tn ($58bn) and 9.4% bigger than the previous budget, which will end in April.

What we know on day 1,402&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine used British Storm Shadow missiles to attack a Russian oil refinery&lt;/strong&gt; on Thursday, the country’s military said. The Novoshakhtinsk refinery was hit by the missiles and “numerous explosions” were recorded, the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff said in a social media post. It has already used the British missiles to attack targets inside Russia. The military also said the Novoshakhtinsk plant was one of the main suppliers of petrol products in southern Russia “and is directly involved in supplying the Russian Federation’s armed forces”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volodymyr&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy said on Thursday that he had “very good” talks with Donald Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner &lt;/strong&gt;about how to end the war. “It was a really good conversation: many details, good ideas, that we discussed,” the Ukrainian president said on Telegram. “There are some new ideas on how to bring the real peace closer, and it concerns formats, meetings, and, certainly, the timeline.” Zelenskyy’s post came a day after he said Ukraine had won some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/24/us-ukraine-edge-closer-joint-plan-end-war-moscow-response-uncertain"&gt;limited concessions&lt;/a&gt; in the latest version of a US-led draft peace plan, which is being reviewed by Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A court in Russia has convicted a pro-war activist and critic of Vladimir Putin of justifying terrorism and sentenced him to six years in prison&lt;/strong&gt;. Sergei Udaltsov, the leader of the Left Front movement that opposes the Russian president and is affiliated with the Communist party, was arrested last year. According to Russian independent news site Mediazona, the charges against him stem from an article Udaltsov posted online in support of another group of Russian activists accused of forming a terrorist organisation. Those activists were convicted earlier this month and given sentences from 16 to 22 years in prison. Udaltsov has rejected the charges against him as fabricated. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/25/sergei-udaltsov-terrorism"&gt;he denounced the verdict as “shameful”&lt;/a&gt; and said he was going on a hunger strike, Mediazona reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin has said it is in contact with the French authorities over the fate of a French political scholar serving a three-year sentence in Russia&lt;/strong&gt; and reportedly facing new charges of espionage. Russia has made “an offer to the French” regarding Laurent Vinatier, arrested in Moscow last year and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/10/laurent-vinatier-french-researcher-jailed-russia-penal-colony"&gt;convicted of collecting military information&lt;/a&gt;, and “the ball is now in France’s court”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. He refused to provide details. French president Emmanuel Macron is following Vinatier’s situation closely, his office said in a statement. A French foreign ministry spokesperson said all government services were fully mobilised to provide consular support to Vinatier and push for his liberation as soon as possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mariupol Drama Theatre that was destroyed in a 2022 Russian airstrike while hundreds of civilians were sheltering in its basement is to open its doors again&lt;/strong&gt;, with Russian occupation authorities heralding the reconstruction as a sign of renewal, while former actors at the theatre denounced the reopening as “dancing on bones”. The Kremlin has made the reconstruction of Mariupol a calling card of its rule in occupied Ukraine, but Moscow’s oversight is accompanied by arrests or exile of critics, along with property seizures that have stripped thousands of Ukrainians of apartments they legally owned, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/25/mariupol-bombed-theatre-reopen-russification-ukraine"&gt;report Shaun Walker, Pjotr Sauer and Artem Mazhulin&lt;/a&gt;.

You can’t see me but I’m shaking my head and grimacing as I type.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/26/hunstman-huge-spider-australia-arachnophobia"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eade51f1ab12d153a5c4e6751110e8cd0de888/509_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=baf4ff10b41293e6595eda5e5dec03cb" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Russian opposition leader sentenced to six years in prison</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/25/sergei-udaltsov-terrorism</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/25/sergei-udaltsov-terrorism</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 19:31:12 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Sergei Udaltsov, Putin critic affiliated with the Communist party, convicted of justifying terrorism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A court in Russia on Thursday convicted a pro-war activist and critic of Vladimir Putin of justifying terrorism and sentenced him to six years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sergei Udaltsov, the leader of the Left Front movement that opposes Putin and is affiliated with the Communist party, was arrested last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/25/sergei-udaltsov-terrorism"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab62f071d152470155070e1cdf360222136a71ca/605_0_4464_3572/master/4464.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fd59577c90c5e878aee5b133b7852714" medium="image"/></item><item><title>My five-year-old daughter is learning to love cricket.

Today we look at the impact of devolution on growing volatility of party political allegiance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year will be pivotal in British politics, and 7 May will be the point around which things pivot. Elections to local councils, the Scottish parliament and the Welsh Senedd will give millions of voters across the UK a chance to express party preferences. Their verdicts could imperil Labour and Conservative leaders. In Wales, Labour might be sent into opposition for the first time since devolution. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/22/caerphilly-byelection-welsh-politics-labour"&gt;Plaid Cymru and Reform UK&lt;/a&gt; are set to make substantial gains. At Holyrood, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/10/snp-holyrood-scottish-parliament-election-party-conference"&gt;the Scottish National party (SNP)&lt;/a&gt; is on course for a majority. That would be an extraordinary defiance of political gravity for a party weighed down by nearly two decades of incumbency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, both Labour and the Tories risk losing scores of councillors as their vote shares are gobbled up by the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/23/lib-dems-aiming-to-go-big-as-they-eye-electoral-opportunity-ed-davey-party-conference"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/02/farage-reform-uk-local-elections-beginning-of-the-end-for-tories"&gt;Reform UK&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/greens-local-election-results-2022-gains"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;. Those results will be taken as evidence that Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch are failing as leaders. But it would be a mistake to filter the results only through that lens. The fragmentation of national allegiances began&amp;nbsp;much&amp;nbsp;longer ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the month of Amnesty International’s annual Write For Rights campaign, I would like to suggest that the pen can still be powerful. Last year’s event generated 4.7m handwritten letters to human rights defenders and their oppressors. Every letter takes time, attention and physical effort. Leaders will always be more impressed by real letters than by easy clicks, and activists under pressure will always feel uplifted when they read personalised messages of solidarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankie Meehan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Singapore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

That would indeed appear to be the case. But one can question how far a Labour government should be looking to the commission for guidance. What seems to not be widely recognised is that when in 2021 the commission was reconstituted by Liz Truss, as the then minister for women and inequalities, it took on a highly politicised form. Of its six current members, four have, or have had, Conservative party affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission’s recently published &lt;a href="https://socialmobility.independent-commission.uk/app/uploads/2025/12/Social-Mobility-Commission-State-of-the-Nation_2025.pdf"&gt;annual report for 2025&lt;/a&gt; provides some useful information on various matters, including regional differences in opportunity structures, youth unemployment and the Neet (not in education, employment or training) problem that the chair now emphasises. However, what also has to be noted from his foreword to the report is the distinct rightwing slant on social mobility that was initiated by his predecessor as chair, Katharine Birbalsingh, and that he maintains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2025/dec/25/social-mobility-is-still-viewed-through-a-rightwing-lens"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d459352c544e4a5e1342893b2a8dbf1fcf411925/143_0_1843_1475/master/1843.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fdfdf9d32db545169fdadbdf5b841ce5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Not an enabler’?

But a week later, Wiles appeared at risk of becoming the family outcast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/25/trump-chief-of-staff-susie-wiles"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03346c98563939fedd7163caa2f508fc18b7a4cb/404_0_4036_3229/master/4036.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e8083a180c377e9573efd77072af35da" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Southern California sees third death from atmospheric river storm drenching region</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/25/southern-california-atmospheric-river-storm</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/25/southern-california-atmospheric-river-storm</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:43:37 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Some parts of LA saw more than 11in of rain, with flooding, road closures and debris flows reported across the region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong rain and wind storm, carried by an atmospheric river from the Pacific, has been blamed for a third death in southern &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; as flooding, road closures and debris flows are reported across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flood watch was also extended through Thursday for almost all of the area, as more than 11in of rainfall was measured in some parts Los Angeles county as of Wednesday night and evacuation warnings were issued for mountain communities in San Bernardino county.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/25/southern-california-atmospheric-river-storm"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5aad0dfe2bf3e6c272a11a1e62621718cf26295/540_0_5396_4317/master/5396.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=303d2482b55c24a434ee694a3a36611b" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Renewed zeal for Boxing Day sales expected to ring up £3.8bn for retailers</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/25/renewed-zeal-for-boxing-day-sales-retailers-consumers</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/25/renewed-zeal-for-boxing-day-sales-retailers-consumers</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:58:26 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;High streets and online sellers set to benefit as cash-strapped consumers eke out post-Christmas bargains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK shoppers are expected to spend £3.8bn this Boxing Day, 2% more than last year, with online sellers experiencing most of that growth but high streets also enjoying a boost from a renewed appetite for post-Christmas bargains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boxing Day remains one of the busiest shopping days of the year, but in recent years the dash for the high street has eased as more people opt to search for bargains from the sofa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/25/renewed-zeal-for-boxing-day-sales-retailers-consumers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cfefe57050be9bc9750d073235c195b19ceea41/386_0_3844_3077/master/3844.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=837d1b2e99b31570f49cab9b05fc749a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>End of shareholder revolt register ‘will help UK firms bury pay controversies’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/25/closure-shareholder-revolt-register-uk-listed-firms-executive-pay-controversies</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/25/closure-shareholder-revolt-register-uk-listed-firms-executive-pay-controversies</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:00:42 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Fears for transparency and governance after closure of public log meant to curb ‘abuses and excess’ in boardrooms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK-listed companies will be able to bury controversies over executive pay for the first time in eight years, a thinktank has warned, after the Labour government shut down a public tracker meant to curb “abuses and excess in the boardroom”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public register was launched under the Tory prime minister Theresa May in 2017 to name and shame companies hit by shareholder revolts at their annual general meetings (AGMs).

This vast impenetrable forest spans the width of the land bridge between South and Central America, but there is almost no way through it: hundreds have lost their lives trying to cross it on foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its size and hostility have shielded it from development for millennia, protecting hundreds of species – from harpy eagles and giant anteaters to jaguars and red-crested tamarins – in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. But it has also made it incredibly difficult to protect. Looking after 575,000 hectares (1,420,856 acres) of beach, mangrove and rainforest with just 20 rangers often felt impossible, says Segundo Sugasti, the director of Darién national park. Like tropical forests all over the world, it has been steadily shrinking, with at least 15% lost to logging, mining and cattle ranching in two decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/25/they-are-scared-of-us-now-how-one-tropical-forest-turned-the-tide-on-loggers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73dccf6cb6cd77671d76a6e6996dd63f5c96d4e3/333_0_3305_2642/master/3305.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=141a4c3f54fd1fbf514c0f6a541b2050" medium="image"/></item><item><title>In 2025 reparations became central to UK ties with the Caribbean and Africa – so how do we move forward? | Kenneth Mohammed</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/25/reparations-caribbean-africa-britain-restorative-justice-slavery</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/25/reparations-caribbean-africa-britain-restorative-justice-slavery</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:00:44 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;This year was a pivotal one, in which the issue of restorative justice began to frame the UK’s post-imperial relationship with the global south&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little while ago, I was interviewed for a forthcoming book about reparations by a black British comedian and his co-writer.

On the ground floor, there’s a corner for foreign literature and another for French literature, with the latest releases right at the front. For nonfiction and essays, you used to have to go downstairs. But two years ago, they put a new table in front of the French literature corner for feminist essays and memoirs. A prime spot for people to grab a piece of the revolution without thinking about it too much. This change took a wild turn when local genius Annie Ernaux won the Nobel prize in 2022. Where should we put her work: in the crowded space for new French literature or the feminist memoir table?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dilemma is now a regular question in France. The Anglosphere and other European countries have been wrestling with it over the past two decades, but here the line between fiction and nonfiction has only just begun to vanish in the minds of authors and their editors. Should we put a new table between the two? It would be a perfect spot for great autofiction such as Édouard Louis’s or Christine Angot’s novels. Or deeply personal nonfiction such as Alice Coffin’s Le Génie Lesbien or Adèle Yon’s bestseller Mon vrai nom est Élisabeth – her first novel and a literary quest to reveal the patriarchal violence suffered by the author’s great-grandmother.

What we know on day 1,401&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would be willing to withdraw troops from the country’s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end Russia’s war&lt;/strong&gt;, if Moscow also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarised zone monitored by international forces. The proposal offered another potential compromise on control of the Donbas region, which has been a major sticking point in peace negotiations. Washington and Kyiv have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/24/us-ukraine-edge-closer-joint-plan-end-war-moscow-response-uncertain"&gt;edged closer to a jointly agreed formula to end the war&lt;/a&gt; amid continuing uncertainty over Moscow’s response. Regardless of whether it is accepted by Moscow, it marks a success for Kyiv in rewriting an earlier US draft that had been criticised as a Kremlin wishlist. Zelenskyy said he expected US negotiators to be in contact with the Kremlin on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A majority of Russians expect the war in Ukraine to end in 2026, a state pollster said&lt;/strong&gt;, in a sign that the Kremlin could be testing public reaction to a possible peace settlement as diplomatic efforts to end the conflict intensify. Officials said 70% of the 1,600 respondents saw 2026 as a more “successful” year for Russia than this year, while for 55% that hope was linked to a possible end to what Russia calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sunflower oil spill, caused by Russian aerial bombardments, has contaminated the shoreline around the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa&lt;/strong&gt;, killing wildlife and triggering warnings from conservationists. Odesa has been targeted with some of the heaviest strikes of the war in recent weeks, in what Ukrainian officials have slammed as an attempt to hobble Ukraine’s maritime network and its vital agricultural exports. The Pivdenny port in the region was temporarily closed on Wednesday to help with the clean-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian air defence units downed 25 Moscow-bound Ukrainian drones on Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.

We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs. That’s the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I’ve never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he’d go down the stairs, wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great, I don’t want to do it.

It was a cold winter and my dad had been gripped by the idea of roasting chestnuts. He had grown up in the southern hemisphere, in a former British colony, so despite the fact that his Christmases were hot – spent in shorts and flip-flops – he had been surrounded by images of snowy churches, robin redbreasts, holly, ivy and, yes, chestnuts roasting on an open fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, he headed out to Clapham Common in south London to collect conkers. They were chestnuts, after all. Horse chestnuts but hey, that’s still a chestnut. Or so he thought. And so, that evening when his British friends arrived at the house where he was staying, they were greeted by the suspiciously acrid smell of about 30 conkers, baking away in the little gas oven, plus a wild-haired man in his 20s primed to chomp into his tray of baked poison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nell Frizzell is a journalist and author&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/father-uk-people-looked-after-him-refugees"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f392cefe4d315a69ee86aca4a77a1b8107ec8f1/324_225_1778_1423/master/1778.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=22de42bd651fd8ee68395df636563088" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘You sneak in and hope you make it back’: the Sudanese volunteers risking it all to bring care to millions</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/24/sudan-war-volunteers-emergency-response-rooms-aid-food-medicine</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/24/sudan-war-volunteers-emergency-response-rooms-aid-food-medicine</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:00:12 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Members of Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms network tell Guardian they didn’t mind missing out on the Nobel peace prize because ‘we only want to help’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing good gets you killed in Sudan.

And nothing symbolises this better than the food and drink that fill our tables. In today’s newsletter we explore Christmas food traditions across the diaspora and how they represent our familial identities and wider communal histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a single route to crafting a Nigerian Christmas table. Traditions vary from family to family, but there are a few staples that you will find at any large, celebratory gathering, regardless of the time of year: mountains of plantain; coleslaw smothered in salad cream or mayonnaise; an array of starters (spring rolls, chicken wings, savoury donut-style &lt;em&gt;puff puff &lt;/em&gt;balls, samosas) endearingly known collectively as “small chops”; two types of rice: fried, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/09/whats-the-secret-to-great-jollof-rice-kitchen-aide"&gt;regional favourite jollof&lt;/a&gt;.

Indeed, this new cultural ritual is now a social media staple that sweeps across our feeds over the festive period. We post about intergenerational debates on politics; stomaching “wokeness” jokes; and the now near-mythical “uncle” character – the older male holding court at the table – exemplified by tweets that go something like: “My uncle just went on a 10-minute rant about [insert topic]. The turkey is dry and so is his take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these situations, many of us are torn between the impulse to call out harmful speech and our (or more often, our mother’s) longing for family harmony. These micro-yuletide tensions are played out at dinner tables across the country and are indicative of broader cultural and political polarisation. Polarisation is amplified by the social media-driven information silos in which we all now live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be proactive, not reactive.&lt;/strong&gt; Start conversations organically, rather than in reaction to a comment or event. This will set an objective tone. Make conversations short and often, rather than one big event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think “big picture”. &lt;/strong&gt;Focus the conversation on the overarching structures at play,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;perpetuated by the attention economy. Where possible, inspire agency around these topics by offering information about online processes and then let them do the critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the positive.&lt;/strong&gt; For young people in particular, focus on positive examples, role models and narratives. This is often much more powerful than talking about the negative examples. Talk to older children and teens about what they can be rather than what they can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kaitlyn Regehr is programme director of digital humanities at University College London, lecturing on digital literacy and the ethical implications of social media and AI.

It comes as polling repeatedly shows that the economy and day-to-day living costs remain at the top of the public’s most pressing concerns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/24/wednesday-briefing-from-cranberries-to-christmas-how-the-climate-crisis-threatens-food-security"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04b942bd8aca4e30abbe19ce8bdbfd7c9474d99d/500_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a216f53288991c4b768d2f4444d3c05d" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘A gamechanger’: 200,000 UK small businesses sign up to TikTok Shop</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/24/uk-small-businesses-sign-up-to-tiktok-shop</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/24/uk-small-businesses-sign-up-to-tiktok-shop</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:00:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Big brands such as Sainsbury’s and M&amp;amp;S also selling directly in app through links in videos and livestreams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is better known for its viral dances and for making &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/25/older-music-has-been-getting-a-second-life-on-tiktok-data-shows"&gt;hits out of forgotten songs&lt;/a&gt;, but the social media site TikTok is becoming a force to be reckoned with as a shopping platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major retailers such as Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, Samsung, QVC, Clarks, and Sainsbury’s are now selling their wares on the site’s e-commerce service, TikTok Shop, alongside more than 200,000 UK small and medium businesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/24/uk-small-businesses-sign-up-to-tiktok-shop"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a72d2a7ca424d4be6132f00ac314b342c2ab014/917_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a6b22e97e56477a0038b0d7aca276ce6" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The hill I will die on: Being late can be the height of good manners and decorum, actually | Rachel Connolly</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/the-hill-i-will-die-on-being-late-good-manners</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/the-hill-i-will-die-on-being-late-good-manners</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:00:05 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing etiquette as a set of categorical rules, we should recognise that poor form can actually have good consequences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people are out there labouring under the impression that lateness is always terribly rude. I am here to tell you this is totally wrong. There are situations when, yes, it is rude. There are situations when it basically doesn’t matter. But there are also situations when being late is actually the height of good manners and decorum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are invited to dinner, especially by a person who you can sense is an inexperienced cook or host, you should endeavour to be late. By at least 10 minutes I would say. But, honestly, if your host is a 25-year-old who has sent you a message saying, “I’m going to try making this :)” and then attached a picture of an elaborate recipe with two separate kinds of molasses, then I would say half an hour is probably best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel Connolly is the author of the novel Lazy City&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/the-hill-i-will-die-on-being-late-good-manners"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1fd451aa4e2abb69b0c92c0b468186f78d9ac06/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b37a5427f5847377fe840e0a40fd9dd4" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘We refuse to be afraid’: solidarity and vigilance in British Jewish community targeted by IS plot</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/24/solidarity-and-vigilance-in-british-jewish-community-targeted-by-islamic-state-plot</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/24/solidarity-and-vigilance-in-british-jewish-community-targeted-by-islamic-state-plot</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:00:06 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Life goes on in a vibrant Greater Manchester neighbourhood after a plan for an attack was thwarted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They tried to kill us.

By 1945, after fleeing the Nazis first to Czechoslovakia, then Palestine, then Britain, Tergit had finished her novel, but it took until 1951 for The Effingers to be published. Even then, only a few German booksellers wanted it in their shops. It was too strange a piece of work for a German public that had watched, if not participated, in the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though overlooked at the time, it has been rediscovered as a classic in Germany, and has now been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/08/the-effingers-a-berlin-saga-by-gabriele-tergit-review"&gt;published in English for the first time&lt;/a&gt;. It is a chronicle of three affluent Jewish families in Berlin between 1878 and 1942, with an epilogue set in 1948, based on Tergit’s return visit to her destroyed city. Tergit understood how dangerous the Nazis were. She was a court reporter and covered Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels on trial in the 1920s – this also made her a target, and she fled Berlin after narrowly escaping an SA (“Brownshirts”) raid in March 1933.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tania Roettger is a journalist based in Berlin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/berlin-evening-class-fascism-afd-far-right-party"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0037713311176b7c58f20aa4150eda462fc1329/375_0_4893_3916/master/4893.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fad9567d51e0bca12bcc3a2a914aad39" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Barracuda, grouper, tuna – and seaweed: Madagascar’s fishers forced to find new ways to survive</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/24/madagascar-coastline-vezo-people-fishing-climate-change-adaptation</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/24/madagascar-coastline-vezo-people-fishing-climate-change-adaptation</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:05 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Seaweed has become a key cash crop as climate change and industrial trawling test the resilient culture of the semi-nomadic Vezo people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along Madagascar’s south-west coast, the Vezo people, who have fished the Mozambique Channel for countless generations, are defined by a way of life sustained by the sea.

What we know on day 1,400&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pope Leo XIV has called for a global truce on Christmas Day, expressing “great sadness” that “apparently Russia rejected a request” for one&lt;/strong&gt;. “I am renewing my request to all people of good will to respect a day of peace – at least on the feast of the birth of our saviour,” Leo told reporters at his residence near Rome on Tuesday. Russia has repeatedly rejected calls for a ceasefire in its war on Ukraine, saying that would only give a military advantage to Kyiv. The pope said: “Among the things that cause me great sadness is the fact that Russia has apparently rejected a request for a truce.” Referring to conflicts in general, Leo said: “I hope they will listen and there will be 24 hours of peace in the whole world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A massive Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine has killed three people and cut power to several Ukrainian regions&lt;/strong&gt; two days before Christmas and as the country enters a period of very cold weather, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/ukrainian-cities-lose-power-in-winter-weather-after-russian-attacks"&gt;report Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer&lt;/a&gt;. Russia sent more than 650 drones and more than 30 missiles into Ukraine in the attack, which began overnight and continued into Tuesday morning, local officials said. At least three people were killed, including a four-year-old child. Poland scrambled fighter jets to protect its airspace during the strike, the country’s army said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Telegram: “A strike before Christmas, when people want to be with their families, at home, in safety … Putin cannot accept the fact that we must stop killing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine struck Russian oil and gas infrastructure, hitting a petrochemical plant &lt;/strong&gt;in southern Russia’s Stavropol region. Regional governor Vladimir Vladimirov said a fire had engulfed the industrial area, while footage on Russian media channels showed towering flames there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The attacks came after weekend talks in Miami involving Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian and Ukrainian representatives&lt;/strong&gt; in separate meetings, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house"&gt;Witkoff called “constructive”&lt;/a&gt; but that showed no apparent breakthroughs. Zelenskyy said he was briefed on the state of the talks on Tuesday and that “several draft documents have now been prepared”, including an outline for ending the war, options for Ukraine’s future security guarantees and plans for the country’s postwar reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia opened a criminal case on Wednesday after an incident in southern Moscow injured traffic police officers&lt;/strong&gt;, the country’s State Investigative Committee said. Several explosions were heard in the area where a Russian general was killed by a car bomb on Monday, the Telegram channels Baza and Shot Telegram reported. The channels, which have sources in Russia’s law enforcement agencies, said that according to witnesses, a car detonated. The reports could not be independently verified. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/russian-general-fanil-sarvarov-killed-car-bomb-moscow-investigators-say"&gt;Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov was killed&lt;/a&gt; on Monday when a bomb exploded under his car in southern Moscow, Russian investigators said, adding they were looking at possible involvement by Ukrainian special services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine pulled out troops from a town in the east after fierce battles&lt;/strong&gt;, the military said on Tuesday. Kyiv had to withdraw the forces from Siversk, a town in the embattled Donetsk region on the way to two last strongholds held by Ukraine. Russia announced the capture of Siversk almost two weeks ago. The Ukrainian army said that “to preserve the lives of our soldiers and the combat capability of our units, Ukrainian defenders have withdrawn from the settlement” of Siversk, adding that fighting was still ongoing on the outskirts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Russian strike could collapse the internal radiation shelter at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, the plant’s director has said. Sergiy Tarakanov told Agence France-Presse that fully restoring the shelter could take three to four years and warned that another Russian strike could cause the inner shell to collapse. “If a missile or drone hits it directly, or even falls somewhere nearby – for example, an Iskander [short-range ballistic missile], God forbid – it will cause a mini-earthquake in the area,” he said in an interview conducted last week. “No one can guarantee that the shelter facility will remain standing after that. That is the main threat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/24/ukraine-war-briefing-pope-leo-expresses-great-sadness-at-russian-rejection-of-truce-calls"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf6d4a61e75c992800b5741dd51bf9c59646dbe1/715_113_4703_3763/master/4703.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a8743c4bfc909e81b242e4ee2c7c36b6" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Former EU commissioner and activists barred from US in attack on European tech regulators</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/24/us-state-department-visa-ban-former-eu-commissioner-europe</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/24/us-state-department-visa-ban-former-eu-commissioner-europe</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:54:32 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;State department accuses group of pressuring tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints through regulation of disinformation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state department has barred five Europeans from the US, accusing them of leading efforts to pressure tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints, in the latest attack on European regulations that target hate speech and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of state Marco Rubio said the five people targeted with visa bans – who include former European Commissioner Thierry Breton – have led “organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/24/us-state-department-visa-ban-former-eu-commissioner-europe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0716ef703053cab4a865adbac966c8452854f88d/377_0_5198_4160/master/5198.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b670f8a37022720364c1d6f7f7e27783" medium="image"/></item><item><title>American woman accused of killing her two children extradited to US from UK</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/kimberlee-singler-extradited</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/kimberlee-singler-extradited</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:56:53 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Kimberlee Singler was arrested in London in 2023, a week after her daughter, 9, and son, 7, found dead in Colorado&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An American woman accused of killing two of her children after a Colorado judge demanded she comply with a custody order has been extradited from Britain, where she was arrested, to the United States to face charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimberlee Singler was arrested in Kensington, west London, by officers from the UK’s National Crime Agency in December 2023, a week after her nine-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son were found dead in their home in Colorado Springs, Colorado.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/kimberlee-singler-extradited"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74a32739f2d10279004adf0d9a8ad80b4486ef0f/0_96_1965_1572/master/1965.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d3eea029457601e844a9d9ec78856768" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Some like it hot: why cold Christmases are a feeble imitation of celebrating in summer | Eleanor Burnard</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/hot-christmas-australia-celebrating-in-summer</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/hot-christmas-australia-celebrating-in-summer</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:00:57 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;This time of year is stressful enough – but at least we don’t have to deal with seasonal depression on top of it all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we have learned anything from the influx of holiday movies, mass-produced decorations, Mariah Carey and the smorgasbord of other jingle bell-infused songs that Big Northern Hemisphere has embedded into our lives, it’s that the cultural zeitgeist has determined that Christmas is a holiday best served cold.

 A broadcast-news neophyte, Weiss has no business in that exalted role. She proved that beyond any remaining doubt last weekend, pulling a powerful and important piece of journalism just days before it was due to air, charging that it wasn’t ready. Whatever her claims about the story’s supposed flaws, this looks like a clear case of censorship-by-editor to protect the interests of powerful, rich and influential people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 60 Minutes piece – about the brutal conditions at an El Salvador prison where the Trump administration has sent Venezuelan migrants without due process – had already been thoroughly edited, fact-checked and sent through the network’s standards desk and its legal department.

Gold is up 70% so far in dollar terms; bitcoin is down 6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, conditions should have been perfect for bitcoin if, like gold, it is supposed to be a store of value in uncertain times. Geopolitical tensions have been high all year, with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/22/donald-trump-latin-america-us-imperialism"&gt;Donald Trump’s unclear intentions towards Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; now added to the mix. Or, if you take the view that bitcoin is a hedge against currency debasement by governments, the news flow ought to have been encouraging. The US budget deficit remains enormous: the International Monetary Fund predicts the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/27/us-debt-set-to-exceed-italy-and-greece"&gt;country’s debts will climb from 125% to 143% of annual income by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, or more than Greece and Italy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/dec/23/bitcoin-buzz-gone-investors-chose-real-gold-in-2025"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/388a1a195d6f4c97107356e42092f3b1de6cb685/389_0_2915_2333/master/2915.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=68ff5cefab20b57d51ebbf5cc987974e" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The valet, the burnt toast, and the trip to Peru: evidence that suggests Andrew link to Ghislaine Maxwell emails</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/the-valet-the-burnt-toast-and-the-trip-to-peru-evidence-that-suggests-andrew-link-to-ghislaine-maxwell-emails</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/the-valet-the-burnt-toast-and-the-trip-to-peru-evidence-that-suggests-andrew-link-to-ghislaine-maxwell-emails</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:01:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Documents released in relation to Jeffrey Epstein contain emails between Maxwell and an individual signing off as ‘A’ and ‘The Invisible Man’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emails between Ghislaine Maxwell and an individual signing off as “A” are among the largest dump yet of documents released by the US Department of Justice in relation to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While “A” – who also refers to themselves as “The Invisible Man” – is not explicitly identified in the emails, they include key details that corroborate the suggestion that they are Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was then still a working royal known as Prince Andrew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/the-valet-the-burnt-toast-and-the-trip-to-peru-evidence-that-suggests-andrew-link-to-ghislaine-maxwell-emails"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4605b9db7e7987fa45768418ca60129bcd6726e/0_0_2758_2206/master/2758.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=295f5fd1f6ad44a24fd996fc63c39c0d" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Some Epstein file redactions are being undone with hacks</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-unredacted-files-social-media</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-unredacted-files-social-media</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:40:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Un-redacted text from released documents began circulating on social media on Monday evening&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People examining documents released by the Department of Justice in the Jeffrey Epstein case discovered that some of the file redaction can be undone with Photoshop techniques, or by simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Un-redacted text from these documents began circulating through social media on Monday evening.

Its launch is timely: more than 1 billion chickens and &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/christmas-dinners-crisis-immensely-challenging-33007721"&gt;around 8 million turkeys&lt;/a&gt; are reared each year – with many of the latter slaughtered in the run-up to Christmas. Winter is also peak season for pet abandonments, with animal charities particularly fearful this year, given the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/20/dog-cat-abandonment-soars-owners-struggle-cost-of-living-crisis"&gt;already high numbers&lt;/a&gt; of dogs and cats being dumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pledges to end the use of cages for laying hens, and cramped farrowing crates for pigs, will be welcomed by&amp;nbsp;all who object to animal cruelty. So will a proposal to&amp;nbsp;replace the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44709905"&gt;carbon dioxide stunning&lt;/a&gt; of pigs with an alternative&amp;nbsp;that is less distressing for them. New rules for farmed fish are also on the way. Until now, fish have been largely excluded from the evolving set of regulations aimed at minimising suffering at the point&amp;nbsp;of slaughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-animal-welfare-a-timely-reminder-that-cruelty-is-wrong"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f6956c62ca3c64d69f6ae7c3b572ae15896a263/0_0_3348_2678/master/3348.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a93086bb25314348f0dd24e287c20151" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The Guardian view on the festive season: a suffering world needs messages of peace, hope and goodwill | Editorial</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-festive-season-a-suffering-world-needs-messages-of-peace-hope-and-goodwill</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-festive-season-a-suffering-world-needs-messages-of-peace-hope-and-goodwill</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:30:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The fracturing multilateral order has led to a new age of insecurity.

But his answer to the question he posed in 1965 was yes. Nobody could live without hope, Tillich told his Harvard audience, even if it led “through the narrows of a painful and courageous ‘in-spite-of’”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty years on, a similar spirit of defiant optimism is needed to navigate our own era of conflict and anxiety. The fourth anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is approaching, and dark political forces menace the social fabric of western liberal democracies.

Indeed, in January, the Atlantic’s Ellen Cushing &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/01/throw-more-parties-loneliness/681203/"&gt;declared that&lt;/a&gt; “America is in a party deficit”, quoting a 2023 Bureau of Labor Statistics report that found only 4.1% of Americans attended or hosted a social event on an average holiday weekend.

Unusually for a rich country, the taxes raised in Greater Manchester, just as in other city regions such as West Yorkshire, Merseyside and the West Midlands, do not meet the cost of providing local public services. Taxes raised in the south-east of England cover the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Forth is a co-founder and the CTO of The Data City, a 35 person tech company in central Leeds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/transport-west-yorkshire-tram-network-delayed-leeds-bradford"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f2a8b09879107fdac34faab79a4d998ba4a07/457_0_4551_3640/master/4551.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8d6ba9d4611e8aaf0784f25e3037450f" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Three inmates captured in Florida after escaping jail near Atlanta</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/jail-escape-captured-florida</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/jail-escape-captured-florida</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:31:59 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Inmates’ escape from DeKalb county jail discovered during routine security check early Monday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three inmates who escaped from a jail east of Atlanta, including one who was being held on a murder charge, have been apprehended in Florida, a member of a federal fugitive taskforce confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Heinze, assistant chief inspector with the US Marshals Service Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force, declined to share further details ahead of a news conference planned in Atlanta later on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/jail-escape-captured-florida"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a30f8763dc92dfaa5cd61d744f2a60d96b9f8abd/0_0_4280_3425/master/4280.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0982c39a92f35c9a17ad444eee05678a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Rare’ squirrels set free together after bonding at Florida hospital for injured wildlife</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/rare-squirrels-set-free-together</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/rare-squirrels-set-free-together</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Big Cypress fox squirrels released as a pair to reduce stress and support natural behaviors during transition back into the wild&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two “rare and elusive” juvenile squirrels have a new home for the holidays after they were injured falling from their nests and spent several weeks in a Florida wildlife “rehab” facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair of Big Cypress fox squirrels, a threatened species so uncommon that the Conservancy of Southwest Florida hasn’t treated one in at least a decade, was &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Tevfxx09wmo"&gt;released back into the wild&lt;/a&gt; at a carefully selected site rich in “high-quality pine and cypress habitat” near the nest where one of them was originally found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/rare-squirrels-set-free-together"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10df58a4f498277e38d6c632360119dfa18194fc/224_0_1921_1536/master/1921.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5726855ee42b20d5a2075ee9a8a2e549" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Now that phones alter our photos without us knowing, how do we know what’s real? | Isabel Brooks</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/smartphones-photos-filters-pictures-software</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/smartphones-photos-filters-pictures-software</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:00:44 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Comparing the pictures taken with my camera’s automatic software to those taken with a ‘zero-processing’ app, the results are shocking.

I took a photo and sent it to her, but on my phone screen, it looked brighter and more vivid than the physical version in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding an Instagram filter is something I would now only do ironically. But is my phone increasing the contrast or making other tweaks without my knowledge? To find out, I downloaded an app with a “zero-processing” feature that claimed to take photos without any software alterations. When comparing the photos my camera takes automatically to the photos taken with this app, the results were shocking. The so-called “raw” photos that lack processing had subtle, muted colours, softer edges – a little grainy – while the processed photos were gorgeous and crisp like the inside of a marble.

Are they merely legend or the aftereffects of a history steeped in racial trauma?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kile Glover was the entertainer in the family, the pride of his stepfather, the R&amp;amp;B superstar Usher. He sang, he danced – he burned CDs of his own music, styled the covers with self-made art and was otherwise expressing his creativity in internet videos before it was trendy. “He would’ve been a YouTube sensation by now,” says his mother, the celebrity stylist Tameka Foster. But that future was thwarted on a family trip to Lake Lanier, just outside his Atlanta home town, in July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kile was only 11 when he was struck by a speeding jetski while tubing and knocked unconscious. Foster, on the island of Saint Martin at the time, managed to get to Kile’s hospital bedside within hours thanks to Usher sending a private plane – an olive branch that came amid a &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tameka-raymond-ushers-status-helped-win-custody/story?id=19969051"&gt;bitterly public&lt;/a&gt; custody battle over their two younger sons. As Kile lay on life support, Foster passed the time Googling for information about Lake Lanier.

She is always on edge, vigilant to the slightest movement, fearful of sudden danger, and has learned to withdraw herself from the chaos in order to survive. She is keenly observant, sees through people around her who are not drinkers to decipher their underlying motives that might flare into unexpected menace, and practiced in passive aggression of which her interview with Vanity Fair is a classic case study. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Wiles defines herself as the child of a raging drunk and it is through that singular lens of her formative experience that she defines her current boss. “I make a specialty of it,” she told the writer Christopher Whipple for his &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-1"&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt; profile of the Trump White House chief of staff in one of the eleven interviews she granted him. Donald Trump, she stated, “has an alcoholic’s personality,” though he does not drink. She didn’t stop there, but elaborated that “high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink. And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.” Trump, she said, “operates [with] a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying Trump has an “alcoholic’s personality” reveals Wiles’ personal understanding about a megalomaniacal celebrity who fosters pandemonium around himself without any care for others. Her father, Pat Summerall, the great football placekicker and the play-by-play broadcaster of National Football League games on CBS for 40 years, was the original bad daddy. “Alcoholism does bad things to relationships, and so it was with my dad and me,” she &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/news/white-house-chief-staff-heart-100000018.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. She remembered him as a mostly absentee father and so drunk he “wouldn’t recognize” his granddaughter, which Wiles thought “horrifying.” Alcoholism, she said, is a “disease that clouds your judgment,” and no one, however smart they think they are can “out think addiction.” In 1992, Wiles and her mother staged an intervention to take him to the Betty Ford Drug Rehab Center. She gave him a letter &lt;a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/the-pat-summerall-link-susie-wiles-alcoholic-personality-comment-for-donald-trump-explained-article-153303712/amp"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt;, “Dad, the few times we’ve been out in public together recently, I’ve been ashamed we shared the same last name.” That is what she means when she says someone has an “alcoholic’s personality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Self-Made-Man-Political-Abraham-Lincoln/dp/1476777268/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=A+Self-Made+Man&amp;amp;qid=1597952377&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;A Self-Made Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wrestling-His-Angel-Political-1849-1856/dp/150115379X/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_1/141-7485861-0988151?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=150115379X&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=a9c485bb-87bd-4934-9aed-937591fb3ecd&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=WPRE2&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=C7lVx&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=4TE076HKJFEC3JAZ6JHR&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=4TE076HKJFEC3JAZ6JHR"&gt;Wrestling With His Angel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Powers-Earth-Political-1856-1863/dp/1476777284"&gt;All the Powers of Earth&lt;/a&gt;.

The shelves are emptying fast, price tags slashed with red pen for the fire sale: after selling books on the site since 1982, the Bookshop Darlinghurst will be closing on Christmas Eve – one week after Guardian Australia visits the store. Lee has worked there for 24 years, greeting customers old and new with ebullience and, sometimes, a hug. Over the decades he has offered book recommendations and life advice to closeted young people, perplexed straight grandparents, and everyone in between. “This has never been about just selling books,” Lee said. “It’s been about looking after people and the community.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/24/sydney-darlinghurst-bookshop-queer-lgbtqi-gay-bookstore-closing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/685664e6811163eed13582c6d41b8b26c57bd87e/479_0_2500_2001/master/2500.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=06ba89ede28f4518e7e88ddab49ab3ed" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Bolsonaro supporters ‘cancel’ Havaianas flip-flop brand over television ad</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-eduardo-havaianas-television-ad-fernanda-torres</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-eduardo-havaianas-television-ad-fernanda-torres</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:02:48 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Son of jailed former Brazilian president says spokesperson for ‘national symbol’ sandals is ‘openly leftwing’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaderless since its figurehead was jailed&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/11/brazil-supreme-court-bolsonaro-guilty-coup"&gt; for attempting a coup&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil’s far right has found a new nemesis: the iconic flip-flop brand Havaianas, which has been “cancelled” by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro"&gt;Jair Bolsonaro&lt;/a&gt;’s supporters over a television advert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy stems from the actor Fernanda Torres – the star of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/03/oscars-im-still-here-brazil-dictatorship"&gt;I’m Still Here&lt;/a&gt;, the Brazilian film that won an Oscar for best international feature – saying in the ad that she hoped audiences would not start 2026 “on the right foot”, but “with both feet”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-eduardo-havaianas-television-ad-fernanda-torres"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61f013c534e222c5ac1a29eaf7605d7725be70d/335_0_4640_3712/master/4640.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1113965e1550cdd48a165a5e3df584b8" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Jeffrey Epstein apparently wrote to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-files-larry-nassar-letter</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-files-larry-nassar-letter</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:24:56 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Letter postmarked three days after Epstein’s death to ex-US gymnastics team doctor contains reference to Trump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/23/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-files-andrew-ghislaine-maxwell-us-politics-live-news-updates"&gt;US politics live – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disturbing letter that appears to have been written by Jeffrey Epstein and sent to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/he-became-our-best-friend-how-we-survived-larry-nassars-systematic-abuse"&gt;Larry Nassar&lt;/a&gt;, the US Olympics gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexual abuse, is included the latest batch of Epstein-related documents released by the US government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you will know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” the letter, which appears to have been signed from Epstein to Nasser, reads. “Good luck!

My boys will wake me up at the crack of dawn then tumble downstairs, falling over each other, to find presents under the tree. As the tearing of wrapping paper cross-fades into screams of excitement, for a moment, everything feels exactly as it should. Except for one subtle difference: my children have never believed in Santa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the result of an “I don’t want to lie to my children” ideology or some Scroogist attempt to be different. It’s a deliberate choice I have made, one that is rooted in fear. Behind the fairy lights and goodwill of Christmas lurk financial demands that many families cannot meet. According to a YouGov poll for debt charity &lt;a href="https://www.stepchange.org/media-centre/press-releases/christmas-polling.aspx"&gt;Step Change&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, about one in three adults with children will struggle to afford Christmas this year.

In case you are not as shamelessly showbiz-pilled as I am, this is a drama that parses like something between the parable of the prodigal son and &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Catherine-de-Medici"&gt;Catherine de Medici&lt;/a&gt;’s tension with her daughter-in-law Mary, Queen of Scots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that, after years of a trying in-law dynamic, relations between the Beckham family and their first-born, Brooklyn, and his wife, &lt;a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/nicola-peltz-breaks-silence-family-33102583"&gt;the heiress Nicola Peltz&lt;/a&gt;, have soured.

Forty years ago she planted an oak tree in a small town in southern Zurich – now at the frontier of beaver expansion – and it has just been felled: gnawed by the large, semi-aquatic rodents as they enter their seasonal home-improvement mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caller is one of 10 new people getting in touch each week at this time of year. Beavers, nature’s great engineers, can unleash mayhem during winter as they renovate their lodges and build up their dams. For people, this can mean flooding, sinkholes appearing in roads and trees being felled. A single incident can clock up 70,000 Swiss francs (£65,000) in damages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/23/how-swizerland-learned-to-live-with-beavers-rewilding-aoe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbdf45a4166bed9478cfb67aba33af5a75169f93/728_0_3560_2848/master/3560.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c27cf042980110f9e8b9de0af0181858" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Tesla’s EU sales slump continues as Chinese rivals thrive</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/23/tesla-eu-sales-slump-continues-as-chinese-rivals-thrive</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/23/tesla-eu-sales-slump-continues-as-chinese-rivals-thrive</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 09:11:38 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s brand sold 12,130 new cars across the EU last month, down from 18,430 in November 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/dec/23/tesla-sales-fall-europe-byd-surges-car-industry-stock-market-ftse-business-live-news-updates"&gt;Business live – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla continued a run of weak sales in the EU in November, with new car registrations of Elon Musk’s brand down a third, while Chinese carmakers’ sales soared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla sold 12,130 new cars across the EU last month, down from 18,430 in November 2024, shrinking its market share from 2.1% to 1.4%, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (Acea), a lobby group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/23/tesla-eu-sales-slump-continues-as-chinese-rivals-thrive"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ade50d12eeb664044dbc5ec1249e1fafc78416b7/89_0_5412_4333/master/5412.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b98a920a4d039ba008e31ca3830ada9a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Biography to tell story behind Russian Telegram founder Pavel Durov</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/biography-russian-telegram-founder-pavel-durov</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/biography-russian-telegram-founder-pavel-durov</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 08:41:06 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The Populist by Nikolay Kononov traces science protege’s rise to tech visionary and free speech defender&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru.

From mid-April 2023, these plans were implemented through measures that intensified over time. At first, Ryanair rolled out facial recognition procedures on its website aimed at users who purchased their ticket through a travel agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, at the end of 2023, when the Authority’s investigation was underway, Ryanair totally or intermittently blocked booking attempts by travel agencies on its website (for example, by blocking payment methods and mass-deleting accounts linked to OTA bookings). In a third phase of its strategy, in early 2024, Ryanair imposed partnership agreements on OTAs and, subsequently, Travel Agent Direct accounts on traditional agencies, containing terms that restricted agencies from offering Ryanair flights in combination with other services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/dec/23/tesla-sales-fall-europe-byd-surges-car-industry-stock-market-ftse-business-live-news-updates"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762bab646db07e58beebad3bac2fdbd8e3d4ca7b/336_0_6776_5421/master/6776.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=451bbf71d9d8b419221a2873d435526f" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Tuesday briefing: What would a Reform-led country look like?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/tuesday-briefing-what-would-a-reform-led-country-look-like</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/tuesday-briefing-what-would-a-reform-led-country-look-like</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 06:45:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: Local government may offer some answers – after winning 677 council seats, Reform’s triumph quickly gave way to reports of chaos, infighting, and scandal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.

The response is pure venom &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are people who argue that Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine is not motivated by fears or imperial ambitions, but by other countries’ disrespect. Russia once commanded authority as one of the world’s two superpowers, but it has since forfeited that status. It knows it has lost the respect of other countries (Barack Obama famously dismissed Russia as just a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/25/barack-obama-russia-regional-power-ukraine-weakness"&gt;regional power&lt;/a&gt;”), and the Ukraine war is its way of winning it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is perhaps surprising is that Donald Trump’s turn against Europe has similar motivations. Putin knows his aggressive revanchism won’t win Russia any love among countries whose respect he craves. But if he can’t be loved, he hopes at least to be feared.

In 2022 laws were whipped through the New South Wales parliament in response to a series of climate protests to prevent protesters disrupting infrastructure and major facilities. They were challenged by the “knitting nanas”, who succeeded in having &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/13/knitting-nannas-claim-partial-victory-in-nsw-anti-protest-law-challenge"&gt;part of the law struck down&lt;/a&gt; for impermissibly burdening the implied freedom of political communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we had the Dural caravan episode, which led to more laws being urgently passed – this time to restrict protests outside places of worship. Again, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/16/nsw-anti-protest-laws-ruled-unconstitutional-after-palestine-action-group-court-challenge"&gt;part of the legislation was struck down&lt;/a&gt;. It had allowed police to issue “move-on” orders to people who were protesting near a place of worship, even though they were not obstructing, harassing or intimidating any people who were entering or leaving the place of worship. But the NSW supreme court held that this went beyond what was necessary to achieve its legitimate purpose of protecting worshippers. There were more narrowly focused equally effective alternatives which could have been adopted and would have had less of a burden on political communication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/nsw-parliament-rushing-anti-protest-laws"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11cd181ff271fd46fcdd8847d931336403966506/700_0_3490_2793/master/3490.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=83df98e45c9e07dfc2e67a06b1bb9a33" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Trump administration plans to promote loyal diplomats after recall of 30 ambassadors, sources say</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-administration-recalls-30-ambassadors-promote-loyal-diplomats</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-administration-recalls-30-ambassadors-promote-loyal-diplomats</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:37:39 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Move comes as union representing US diplomats said it was ‘deeply concerned’ by the process, which could ‘politicise’ foreign service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has quietly recalled nearly 30 ambassadors and other senior overseas diplomats as the Trump administration plans to promote appointees loyal to the new administration to higher levels of the state department, according to diplomatic sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/trump-administration-recalls-diplomats"&gt;recall of the ambassadors or heads of mission&lt;/a&gt;, which were confirmed by several current and former senior diplomats, was unusual for targeting career foreign service officers heading embassies overseas who are generally left in place after a change in administration because they strive to be apolitical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-administration-recalls-30-ambassadors-promote-loyal-diplomats"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/673de687b380d98648fffe0d682e1428ee7774f7/308_0_3033_2426/master/3033.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b28f6283b7e4b39a160ee9a47872c2aa" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Russia and China pledge support for Venezuela as Trump ratchets up pressure on Maduro</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/russia-china-support-venezuela-trump-pressure-maduro</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/russia-china-support-venezuela-trump-pressure-maduro</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 02:52:39 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Trump again called for Venezuela’s president to leave power and said the US would keep or sell the oil it had seized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China and Russia have expressed support for Venezuela as it confronts a US blockade of sanctioned oil tankers, while Donald Trump continues to ramp up his pressure campaign on the South American country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid reports of slowing activity at Venezuelan ports, the US president again called for Maduro to leave power, and reiterated that the US would keep or sell the oil it had seized off the coast of Venezuela in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/russia-china-support-venezuela-trump-pressure-maduro"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9eb15a34f57e24391b3c3d5a264389e053718b6/792_211_6504_5206/master/6504.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=798a345bb401eaf708038aa9e7e4cf3e" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Fiji wrestles with plans to restore Indigenous rights over world-famous surf breaks</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/fiji-surfing-cloudbreak-restore-indigenous-rights</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/fiji-surfing-cloudbreak-restore-indigenous-rights</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:05:41 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Move to bring back customary marine rights is celebrated, but concerns remain about potential effect on tourism and lack of clarity about how it might work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Fiji, babies know a connection to the sea from birth; their umbilical cords, or vicovico, are sometimes implanted in the reefs that frame the coastal Pacific nation, embedded among the coral.

What we know on day 1,399&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian forces struck Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa&lt;/strong&gt; late on Monday and damaged port facilities and a ship, the regional governor said, in the second attack on the region in less than 24 hours. Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that emergency crews were tackling the aftermath of the latest attack and that no casualties had been reported but provided no further details. An earlier overnight attack hit port and energy infrastructure in the Odesa region, causing a fire at a major port and disrupting electricity supplies to tens of thousands of people. “Russia is attempting to disrupt maritime logistics by launching systematic attacks on port and energy infrastructure,” deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba said on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Russian general was killed after an explosive device detonated beneath his car&lt;/strong&gt; in what Moscow described as a likely assassination carried out by Ukrainian intelligence services, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/russian-general-fanil-sarvarov-killed-car-bomb-moscow-investigators-say"&gt;reports Pjotr Sauer&lt;/a&gt;. Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, head of the operational training directorate of the Russian armed forces’ general staff, died of his injuries, a spokesperson for Russia’s investigative committee said. “Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder.” Russian Telegram channels with links to the security services reported that Sarvarov’s car exploded while driving along a Moscow street about 7am on Monday. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump has said talks to end the Ukraine war are going “OK”&lt;/strong&gt;, a day after his envoy Steve Witkoff characterised US discussions with Ukrainian and European representatives in Florida as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house"&gt;“productive and constructive”&lt;/a&gt;. “The talks are going along,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday. “We are talking. It’s going OK.” Asked if he planned to speak to Volodymyr Zelenskyy or Vladimir Putin, Trump didn’t say, offering only of the fighting: “I’d like to see it stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy said initial drafts of US proposals for a peace deal met many of Kyiv’s demands&lt;/strong&gt; but suggested neither side in the war was likely to get everything it wanted in talks on a settlement. “Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian president said on Monday of the latest talks with US officials. “There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either.” Trump has been pushing for a peace deal for months but has run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moscow said parallel talks between Russia and the US in Miami at the weekend should not be seen as a breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt;. “This is a working process,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said when asked whether the talks could be seen as a turning point. The Izvestia news outlet cited him as saying in remarks published on Tuesday that discussions were expected to continue in a “meticulous” format and that Russia’s priority was to obtain from the US details of Washington’s work with Europeans and Ukrainians on a possible settlement. He said Moscow would then judge how far those ideas matched what he called the “spirit of Anchorage”, after the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-putin-alaska-meeting-ukraine"&gt;Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy has said residents of a border village taken into Russia by Moscow’s troops had interacted with their neighbours for years&lt;/strong&gt; without incident. The Ukrainian president on Monday confirmed media reports that residents of Hrabovske village – on the Sumy region’s border and home to 52 people – were taken away by Russian troops. “I think they simply didn’t expect Russian troops to simply walk in and take them away as prisoners,” Zelenskyy said. “But that’s what happened.” The Kremlin has not commented on the situation. The Ukrainian army has said it is battling an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/ukraine-war-briefing-kyivs-forces-battle-russian-push-to-break-through-in-sumy-region"&gt;attempted Russian breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; in the north-eastern Ukrainian region, where Russian forces have recently seized several villages near the border.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-forces-attack-odesa-twice-in-one-day"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/845448aff273e0f4d207105faac545916c5532c6/1113_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=95402ca6aa9a1101778a26d2cf6c1b5f" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Trump complains Epstein files are damaging people who ‘innocently met’ him</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-complains-epstein-files-are-damaging-people-who-innocently-met-him</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-complains-epstein-files-are-damaging-people-who-innocently-met-him</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 02:17:18 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In his first comments since the release, the president expressed sympathy for high-profiles figures, including Bill Clinton, who have come under scrutiny&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has broken his silence on the release of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein"&gt;Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/a&gt; files, complaining that people who “innocently met” the convicted paedophile could have their reputations destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first comments since the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-us-justice-department"&gt;justice department began releasing the materials&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, the US president on Monday expressed sympathy for prominent Democrats who have come under renewed scrutiny over their associations with Epstein.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-complains-epstein-files-are-damaging-people-who-innocently-met-him"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef461379f3602acafc5a836a186c82bca7f5d1ab/364_0_3632_2906/master/3632.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a54a3e5c4909a86cd08cf8a825e666aa" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Democratic states sue to block Trump’s defunding of US consumer watchdog</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/democrats-lawsuit-trump-consumer-financial-protection-bureau</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/democrats-lawsuit-trump-consumer-financial-protection-bureau</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:41:11 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general from 21 states and DC argue defunding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unlawful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coalition of Democratic-led states filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking to prevent Donald Trump’s administration from defunding the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by refusing to request money from the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic attorneys general from 21 states and the District of Columbia filed the lawsuit in federal court in Oregon, arguing that the administration’s decision not to seek additional funding for the US consumer watchdog is unlawful and undermines Congress’ authority under the US constitution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/democrats-lawsuit-trump-consumer-financial-protection-bureau"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/442fae4ee33ee01b57c7ca5b74476c04293881b9/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7b27db10667da9c67e6362c63c3a8981" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Australia’s gun laws have long been the envy of the world.

There’s a long-overdue national focus on antisemitism, something that the Jewish community has been worried about as long as I have been alive. There’s the ongoing concern about national security, and questions about how something like this could have happened. But to me, as a public health expert and Jewish Australian, perhaps the most important conversation we are finally having is the one about guns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts have been &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2021/04/28/new-gun-ownership-figures-revealed-25-years-on-from-port-arthur.html"&gt;warning about guns&lt;/a&gt; for at least a decade. In the wake of the Port Arthur massacre, Australians came together and implemented a suite of measures to curb gun violence across the country. And it worked. Prior to 1996, we saw about one mass shooting a year. In the decades since, we have seen vanishingly few major events, and none with a death toll anywhere close to the shootings of the 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/australia-gun-laws-envy-of-world-must-remain-after-bondi-ntwnfb"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9f5b9687650997980bda7b818b2d8013619da5/212_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0c5d9573845a869276217d50e45859b5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>New York school board investigates wooden ‘timeout’ box allegations</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/new-york-school-board-wooden-box-claims</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/new-york-school-board-wooden-box-claims</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:00:26 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Governor calls accusations that students with disabilities may have been confined in boxes ‘highly disturbing’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A school district board in upstate New York is investigating school officials amid accusations that the district may have confined elementary school students inside wooden “timeout” boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of the boxes, which resemble tiny padded cells, first spread on social media last week, after a &lt;a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2025/12/16/social-media-posts-about-wooden-box-mohawk-school-prompts-police-investigation/"&gt;former member of the Salmon River school district school board&lt;/a&gt; accused officials of building them to seclude children with disabilities.

Eventually, other countries may go down a similar route&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictions of the demise of letter writing are not new. The invention of the telegraph and the rise of the postcard were both &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1749975515573267"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; as potential threats to a more leisurely, reflective form of communication. Yet by the close of the 20th century, more letters were being sent than ever, as social correspondence began to be supplemented by a boom in business mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Europe’s most tech-savvy society, however, comes ominous news. As of next week, Denmark’s state-run postal service will &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/21/denmark-postnord-postal-delivery-letters-society"&gt;end&lt;/a&gt; all letter deliveries after doing the rounds for 400 years. Around 1,500 jobs are being cut, and the country’s beloved red letterboxes are being sold off. It will still be possible for Danes to send a card or a love letter to someone far away next Christmas, but only via the shops of a smaller private company or a costly home collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For decades, City &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Guilds has helped young people and adults get the skills they need to build their lives. That legacy now&amp;nbsp;feels like it’s hanging by a thread due to the reported £22m cost-cutting drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s just as worrying is the apparent shift from a nonprofit mindset to a profit-driven one. If education becomes just another business, there’s always a risk that profit comes before impact. For many learners – especially those with few other options – vocational training is their path forward.

The WLM was a movement, not an organisation or a party. The national women’s liberation conferences that happened in those years often functioned as national “consciousness-raising” exercises. The most important “votes” were often about adding demands to our growing list, sometimes after long and volatile debates and discussions of emerging issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/collecting-memories-and-stories-of-feminists"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2955d89341cb6ae91dcd9a4b778f8eaea8bc7276/0_1107_4428_3542/master/4428.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=85c7d0555b8348bdcd8fc8a2077f240b" medium="image"/></item><item><title>All children should have access to arts education | Letters</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/22/all-children-should-have-access-to-arts-education</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/22/all-children-should-have-access-to-arts-education</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 17:34:43 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Readers respond to an article by Martin Kettle about the impact of educational inequality on Britain’s cultural sector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Kettle’s article is spot-on (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/18/keir-starmer-music-edward-heath-arts-culture-funding"&gt;Keir Starmer is our most musical prime minister since Edward Heath. He must take up the baton for the arts, 18 December&lt;/a&gt;). The provision of musical education in state schools has declined in the last few decades, and although the pre-Christmas period may give us a chance to hear some lovely music, the reality is that &lt;a href="https://www.suttontrust.com/news-opinion/all-news-opinion/research-reveals-stark-class-inequalities-in-access-to-the-creative-industries/"&gt;most practising musicians&lt;/a&gt; are the product of private schools. Parents of state school pupils may cringe at their children’s performances, with few managing their instruments, and little evidence of input from qualified music teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obituary of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/17/sir-humphrey-burton-obituary"&gt;Humphrey Burton&lt;/a&gt; in the same issue also highlights what we have lost over recent decades in the media, with the BBC Proms and a watered-down Radio 3 doing little to keep the country’s music culture alive. Kettle mentions Alan&amp;nbsp;Bennett’s closing lines of The History Boys – “pass&amp;nbsp;it on, boys” – which urge us to recognise the worth of what this country has inherited. Unfortunately, there is not much serious discussion of contemporary music culture in the Guardian either, to alert us to what is on offer nationally or regionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/22/all-children-should-have-access-to-arts-education"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f64818265b0574af2192cc20dce46d0a2f496b/307_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e38e19183d1e5b12d4b41ae671228b3e" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Portugal’s far-right Chega party ordered to take down posters targeting Roma people</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/portugals-far-right-chega-party-ordered-to-take-down-posters-targeting-roma-people</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/portugals-far-right-chega-party-ordered-to-take-down-posters-targeting-roma-people</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:55:46 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Lisbon court rules the posters could incite hatred and tells party leader Andre Ventura to remove them within 24 hours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leader of Portugal’s far-right Chega party has been ordered to remove street posters attacking the Roma community, after a Lisbon court ruled they were discriminatory and could incite hatred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Ana Barao said the posters’ wording “attacks an ethnic minority” and she gave Andre Ventura 24 hours to remove them or face a daily fine of €2,500 (£2,200) per poster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/portugals-far-right-chega-party-ordered-to-take-down-posters-targeting-roma-people"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdd861d738e3a4d467d80cad47b17f2fdc8ceded/261_0_2608_2086/master/2608.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=31a0eec3342ebef78c9d5f8d11aa8367" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Did you solve it?

News must be something someone somewhere doesn’t want printed, says the old maxim. Well, battalions of interests want to suppress good news: the overwhelmingly Tory or Reform UK press and antisocial media sites don’t want any stories to surface that might do credit to a Labour government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among this deluge of disinformation and malevolence, when asked, a sour and disengaged electorate struggles to think of anything good this government has done. True, the prime minister and his cabinet are partly to blame for failing to tell their story, paint their picture, draw us a map of where they are going and why. They too often do good by stealth, afraid of what the right and business might say if they dare trumpet the strong social justice themes that drive most of what they do. But lay out what the government has done and there it is, plain as a pikestaff. There have been blunders, missteps, bad timing and wrongheaded manifesto pledges, but follow the money to define its identity. What has Labour raised from whom and how was it spent?

But they seem largely to reflect information that has already been made public&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of public outcry and pressure from within the Maga coalition, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;’s justice department released what it called The Epstein Files, with the Trump world’s typical fanfare. A media frenzy ensued. But the “files” that were released by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi"&gt;Pam Bondi&lt;/a&gt;’s Department of Justice left many observers frustrated and confused. The release was partial and heavily redacted; much of the information had already been made public. Media figures were incensed, and members of Congress pledged to push the Trump administration for more. The episode left Washington watchers frustrated. It fueled speculation that Trump, who had long opposed the release of the documents, had something to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was on 27 February, when a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/right-wing-influencers-get-binders-labeled-the-epstein-files-but-downplay-revelations/"&gt;group of 15 rightwing media figures&lt;/a&gt; who had taken a special interest in the Epstein case were summoned to the White House and given white binders labeled “The Epstein Files.” The release was meant to allay pressure from the president’s conspiracy-minded base and neutralize the Epstein issue, which has dogged Trump since the financier sex offender and former close friend of the president died in prison during his first term in 2019. But those who received the binders said that there was little new information in them. The episode only further inflamed tensions and increased the salience of the Epstein issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/22/epstein-files-trump-bondi-justice-department"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e17c7e9d8f1ea8c456495a30fabd025ae8471a/312_0_3120_2496/master/3120.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d6b38412a2c053340068345d1290d887" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Calls for penalties as outrage grows over limited release of Epstein files – US politics live</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/22/reaction-limited-epstein-files-photos-us-politics-latest-updates</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/22/reaction-limited-epstein-files-photos-us-politics-latest-updates</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 13:43:01 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie build bipartisan coalition to hold attorney general Pam Bondi in contempt of Congress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reactions from lawmakers after the document release:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the weekend, top democrat on the oversight committee Robert Garcia and top Democrat on the judiciary committee Jamie Raskin announced they are examining all legal options after the heavily redacted document dump, which they say &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/conservative-response-epstein-release"&gt;violated federal law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

True to form, Putin seemed unperturbed that nearly four years into the war his army had managed to fully occupy only Luhansk, despite having already taken control of more than a third of that region, as well as Donetsk, by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin’s unyielding stance shouldn’t be a surprise.

Marked on the surface by protests, political pendulum swings and spectacular scandals, most of the region has, since the democratisation of the 1980s and 1990s, remained firmly democratic and free of war between states. Though scarred by the violence of armed groups and increasingly powerful criminal organisations, it has, by and large, lived up to its self-assumed moniker of a “zone of peace”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is why this year has felt so jarring. Throughout 2025, the first year of Donald Trump’s second term, analysts have obsessively parsed potential US military incursions into a hemisphere once defined by its unified defence of national sovereignty. But the fixation on whether Washington’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/sheinbaum-un-trump-venezuela-oil-blockade"&gt;escalating pressure&lt;/a&gt; on Nicolás Maduro presages a physical military invasion of Venezuela has distracted from the real story: the larger&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;shift towards direct intervention has already happened, and it has faced remarkably little resistance. More than 100 people have been killed in US maritime strikes that experts characterise as &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/16/us-military-boat-strikes-constitute-extrajudicial-killings"&gt;extrajudicial executions&lt;/a&gt;, and the loudest objections have come not from Latin American presidents or regional organisations, but from the US Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordana Timerman is a journalist based in Buenos Aires.

This summer, the Palestinian journalist &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ll2e_dWCHR8"&gt;broke down&lt;/a&gt; while reporting on starvation in his home town that is now a war zone. A &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/11/israel-gaza-anas-al-sharif-al-jazeera/"&gt;bystander told him&lt;/a&gt;: “Persist, Anas, you are our voice”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But al-Sharif’s popularity in Gaza made him a target. In July, international agencies &lt;a href="https://cpj.org/2025/07/cpj-calls-for-anas-al-sharifs-protection-in-face-of-israeli-smears/"&gt;warned of the danger&lt;/a&gt; he was in as the Israel Defense Forces stepped up online attacks, falsely labelling him a Hamas terrorist. His employer, Al Jazeera, insisted he restrict his reporting to the more protected al-Shifa hospital after his father and many colleagues were killed. In August, a few months short of his 29th birthday, al-Sharif and six others were killed in a direct attack on a media tent next to the hospital. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/11/anas-al-sharif-al-jazeera-journalist-killed-gaza-israeli-airstrike"&gt;In a posthumous post&lt;/a&gt; he said: “If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

While streets glow with fairy lights and shop windows promise that compassion is only a gift-box away, Germany is once again confronted with the unresolved wounds of its recent past. The trap of the season is this: believing that every gesture of regret must be met with mercy. As if forgiveness was a resource available to anyone who is reasonable enough to move on, no matter how atrociously they have been treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is certainly not that simple for the families of the victims of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/neo-nazi-murders-revealing-germanys-darkest-secrets"&gt;National Socialist Underground&lt;/a&gt; (NSU). During the 2000s, the neo-Nazi terror organisation killed 10 people, nine of them immigrants, mostly small business owners, and one policewoman. Because investigators focused on probing the victims’ families and communities rather than on Nazis, the NSU was able to continue murdering without interference. German media reported on the atrocities as &lt;em&gt;die Dönermorde&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/de/nsu-mordserie-warum-auch-die-medien-versagten/a-54856445"&gt;kebab murders&lt;/a&gt;, as if it was some exotic true-crime phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a Guardian Europe columnist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/22/christmas-is-a-season-for-forgiveness-but-is-saying-sorry-enough"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a2c78177ceb2a6c8cffe84fd766a1dfffa3c10/0_0_3055_2444/master/3055.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=632cefeda340d5abc4866f3c20a459a8" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Man jailed for 1,335 years as El Salvador sentences almost 250 MS-13 gang members</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/man-jailed-1335-years-el-salvador-sentences-ms-13-gang-members</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/man-jailed-1335-years-el-salvador-sentences-ms-13-gang-members</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 04:29:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Attorney general’s office also says 10 people received prison terms from 463 to 958 years amid crackdown on gangs under state of emergency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Salvador has announced prison sentences for hundreds of gang members, with some of the convicted receiving terms of hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney general’s office &lt;a href="https://x.com/FGR_SV/status/2002789149418680829"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt; that 248 members of the notorious Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) street gang had received “exemplary sentences” for 43 homicides and 42 disappearances, among other crimes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/man-jailed-1335-years-el-salvador-sentences-ms-13-gang-members"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d967e10db2f4bf44edfdf50236aee01e7129c03d/427_0_4267_3416/master/4267.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=601012227e3dbc28e54703ec77d87cc8" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Slightly haunted but manageable’: new signs cause confusion – and delight – in Christchurch</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/new-zealand-christchurch-spoof-absurdist-road-signs</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/new-zealand-christchurch-spoof-absurdist-road-signs</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 02:28:46 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Six absurdist signs resembling official city council information boards have popped up across New Zealand’s second-largest city&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside an abandoned building in New Zealand’s second-biggest city, a sign reads “slightly haunted but manageable”.

What we know on day 1,398&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian army was battling an attempted Russian breakthrough in the Sumy region&lt;/strong&gt;, it said on Sunday, after reports that Moscow forcibly moved 50 people from a border village there. That marks a renewed Russian advance in the part of the region largely spared from intense ground fighting since Ukraine regained land there in a 2022 counteroffensive. “Fighting is currently ongoing in the village of Grabovske,” Ukraine’s joint taskforce said, adding the troops were “making efforts to drive the occupiers back into Russian territory”. It has also refuted media reports saying Moscow’s troops were in the neighbouring Ryasne village. Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian rights ombudsman said Russian troops forcibly moved about 50 people from Grabovske to Russia. There was no official comment from Russia. On Saturday, the Russian army said it had captured the village of Vysoke, a short distance from Grabovske.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US and Ukrainian envoys issued a joint statement on Sunday saying talks in Miami had been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house"&gt;“productive and constructive”&lt;/a&gt; but did not announce any apparent breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt; in efforts to end the Russian invasion. “Over the last three days in Florida, the Ukrainian delegation held a series of productive and constructive meetings with American and European partners,” Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Ukraine’s top negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said in separate statements on X on Sunday. Witkoff posted: “Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin on Sunday denied that three-way talks between Ukraine, Russia and the US were on the cards. &lt;/strong&gt;Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a day earlier that Washington had mooted the trilateral format, which would mark Moscow and Kyiv’s first face-to-face negotiations in half a year, but the Ukrainian president expressed scepticism that they would lead to progress. Russian news agencies reported Vladimir Putin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, as telling reporters: “At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not in preparation.” Russian representatives have also been in southern Florida for discussions with the US over Ukraine, with a Kremlin envoy saying on Saturday that the talks had been pressing on “constructively”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keir Starmer discussed efforts to achieve a “just and lasting end” to the war in a Sunday call with Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;, the British prime minister’s office said in a statement after the Florida talks. “The two leaders began by reflecting on the war in Ukraine,” Starmer’s office said in a readout of the call, adding they had discussed the work of the so-called “coalition of the willing” countries that have pledged to support Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/21/kremlin-russia-ukraine-war-end-changes-europe-miami-talks"&gt;renewed its criticism&lt;/a&gt; of efforts by Europe and Ukraine to amend US proposals to end the war in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, saying they did not improve prospects for peace. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/21/kremlin-russia-ukraine-war-end-changes-europe-miami-talks"&gt;Rory Carroll reports&lt;/a&gt; that Putin aide Ushakov told reporters on Sunday that the proposed tweaks to Washington’s plan could prolong the conflict. “I am sure that the proposals that the Europeans and Ukrainians have made or are trying to make definitely do not improve the document and do not improve the possibility of achieving long-term peace,” Ushakov said. He added that he had not seen the exact proposals and that his criticism was “not a forecast”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US intelligence reports continue to warn that Putin has not abandoned his aims of capturing all of Ukraine and reclaiming parts of Europe&lt;/strong&gt; that belonged to the former Soviet empire, Reuters reported six sources familiar with intelligence as saying, even as negotiators seek an end to the war that would leave Russia with far less territory. The most recent of the reports dates from late September, one of the sources said. The intelligence contradicts the Russian leader’s denials that he is a threat to Europe. “The intelligence has always been that Putin wants more,” Mike Quigley, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, told Reuters. “The Europeans are convinced of it. The Poles are absolutely convinced of it. The Baltics think they’re first.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/ukraine-war-briefing-kyivs-forces-battle-russian-push-to-break-through-in-sumy-region"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b2bcdc6dfd4345663810361a1c32969b6c34b0a/503_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d18bc20aeb3d7e2e881cf52e6d588760" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Ukrainian and European officials had ‘productive’ talks on ending war, US envoy says</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 23:04:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Witkoff says representatives share goals to stop killing, support Ukraine and end war with Russia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A White House envoy said on Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555bbdc6be39277f32e3fddf197c2fd669e6c085/216_0_4049_3240/master/4049.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9f89ba00f0b47fc9163b4c6c6ee58d9d" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Louisiana nursing student speaks out during her six-month ICE detention</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/louisiana-nursing-student-ice-detention</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/louisiana-nursing-student-ice-detention</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 22:36:44 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Vilma Palacios, 22, tells local outlet ‘I want my freedom back’ as she may be forced to return to Honduras&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent graduate of the LSU Health New Orleans School of Nursing has been held in an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement"&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt; processing center in Basile, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, for the past six months following her arrest by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt; agents over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vilma Palacios had just recently accepted a position at Touro Infirmary when ICE agents arrested her and transferred her to the processing center in Basile.

For years, Texas has consistently been a top-ranking state in book ban attempts in schools and libraries, according to the American Library Association (&lt;a href="https://www.ala.org/"&gt;ALA&lt;/a&gt;), which publishes annual censorship reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest report for 2024, the organization recorded &lt;a href="https://www.ala.org/news/2025/04/american-library-association-kicks-national-library-week-top-10-most-challenged-books"&gt;821 attempts&lt;/a&gt; to ban library books and other materials in the US. Many of these books are first challenged before banned, and they are often not from the disgruntled parents you may be thinking of. According to the ALA, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/08/majority-of-attempts-to-ban-books-in-us-come-from-organised-groups-not-parents"&gt;most censorship attempts&lt;/a&gt; last year came from “pressure groups and decision makers who have been swayed by them”. The most common reasons for book challenges: objections to sexual content and themes around race and racism, LGBTQ+ and other social justice issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter-us/2025/dec/21/banned-books-gift-ideas-guide"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec1fa14a406713b750e67bfab5d994dccc1db0a7/230_196_3888_3112/master/3888.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=17ba8e494630ed7c1c28099ad8ace4cc" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Mass power outages affect 130,000 in San Francisco and disrupt traffic</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/power-outages-san-francisco-traffic-waymo-taxis-traffic</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/power-outages-san-francisco-traffic-waymo-taxis-traffic</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 20:20:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Traffic signals failed in large portions of the California city while Waymo robotaxis stopped in streets and intersections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A widespread power failure plunged &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; into darkness on Saturday night, disrupting traffic citywide and forcing numerous self-driving &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/waymo"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; taxis to stop abruptly in the middle of streets and intersections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As electricity went out across large portions of the city, traffic signals failed, leaving autonomous vehicles unable to operate as normal. &lt;a href="https://x.com/Jason/status/2002583426067804582?"&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/WhereIsMishaal/status/2002587200681390318"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; shared by users on X showed Waymo robotaxis frozen in place, backing up traffic and creating hazardous conditions for other drivers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/power-outages-san-francisco-traffic-waymo-taxis-traffic"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b07300b04fda20302f02a287c5982bbd10a6b9c/123_0_4945_3956/master/4945.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=3cb6c8db451c09f98e70dcce925bb472" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Miracle’ of Zealandia: chick is born to rare takahē pair thought to be infertile</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/takahe-chick-rare-born-new-zealand</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/takahe-chick-rare-born-new-zealand</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:00:05 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Unexpected arrival is a boon for birdlife in New Zealand, where there are only 500 takahē left&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pair of rare native &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; takahē birds who were believed infertile have stunned staff at the world’s largest urban eco-sanctuary, after hatching a “miracle” chick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roughly seven-week old chick was discovered inside Zealandia, a fully fenced eco-sanctuary 10 minutes from Wellington’s city centre, in November, but its arrival has been a closely guarded secret to ensure its safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/takahe-chick-rare-born-new-zealand"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a46b000014478b347fa9f37025ddef73ec0eb129/0_0_1000_800/master/1000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2a7aa03b5eb4cffc5d8ffd80e866cf40" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Cycling is changing at speed – but is Britain keeping pace?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/21/cycling-changing-at-speed-britain-keeping-pace</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/21/cycling-changing-at-speed-britain-keeping-pace</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 10:00:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Emulating the bike-friendly highways enjoyed by our continental neighbours  will take a lot more money and political will&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Team GB’s velodrome successes at the 2008 Olympics, campaigners and government ministers have confidently predicted that Britain is about to become a nation of cyclists.

Britain must build NHS capacity so that cures become collective goods, not expensive products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/mutationsanddisorders/neutralmutations/"&gt;small fraction&lt;/a&gt; of our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome"&gt;20,000 genes&lt;/a&gt; can cause disease when disrupted – yet that sliver accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c70z8ppjlddo"&gt;thousands of rare disorders&lt;/a&gt;. The difficulty is: what can a doctor do to treat them? In a common condition such as type 2 diabetes, the underlying biology is similar for millions of patients. The doctor can prescribe &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/metformin/"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt;. But with a genetic disorder, the mutation might only affect a small number of people worldwide. In many cases, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/may/23/blood-test-could-speed-diagnosis-rare-diseases-babies"&gt;doctors&lt;/a&gt; won’t even know which mutation is responsible, let alone how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel gene-editing breakthroughs are making &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj38ymeyg4mo"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt;. But therapies are expensive and complex to develop. The cost of bringing any new drug to patients is now around $2bn, in part because, as Brian&amp;nbsp;David&amp;nbsp;Smith notes in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo6ofSBsfA4"&gt;New Drugs, Fair Prices&lt;/a&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;“success rate, from discovery to market, is tiny” and there are approved treatments for “less than 10% of the 8,000&amp;nbsp;diseases that affect humans”. Commercial&amp;nbsp;incentives, he argues, skew innovation towards lucrative cancer drugs and long-term treatments for large populations. Complex gene therapies for very rare conditions are seen as too costly&amp;nbsp;to develop and too small to profit from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/21/the-guardian-view-on-gene-editing-breakthroughs-need-a-new-social-contract"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07b4358bf657bc1620a2bee05ba696f0c6930fdb/487_0_4297_3437/master/4297.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0283460d60809a210b2e7b5214dd6819" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Officer who fatally shot Tamir Rice fired from West Virginia ranger position</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/officer-fired-tamir-rice-shooting</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/officer-fired-tamir-rice-shooting</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 17:34:03 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Timothy Loehmann’s firing is fourth known time in seven years that he left a department following public backlash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Cleveland officer who fatally shot 12-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tamir-rice"&gt;Tamir Rice&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 was fired from his post as a ranger at a West Virginia resort community, the fourth known time in seven years that he left a small department following public backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy Loehmann was fired on Friday from his position at the Snowshoe Resort Community District (SRCD).

Until Brexit, there were diverse chances for students to sample courses, cultures and environments in unfamiliar settings, enriching their experiences in ways that had lasting benefits. As one example, I looked after the UK arm of a consortium of European universities that enabled up to 10 students each year from each of six participating universities from six European countries to attend a 10-day environmental field course in one of these countries. We were able to continue this arrangement without a break for 12 years from 1997, funded almost entirely through Erasmus, so the cost to students was minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field course venue was hosted by rotation, so each university only had to organise the course once every five or six years. Every year, participating students experienced working closely with peers from each country, and were exposed to different ideas and ways of approaching environmental issues, and environments that included the Mediterranean, central Europe and the far north.

Here’s how we are standing against it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump wants us to believe that the “war on Christianity” is spreading across the globe. The US president recently sounded the alarm on the “&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-threatens-nigeria-with-potential-military-action-over-claims-of-christian-persecution"&gt;mass slaughter&lt;/a&gt;” of Christians in Nigeria while threatening a &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-threatens-nigeria-with-potential-military-action-over-claims-of-christian-persecution"&gt;US invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the African nation. We shouldn’t be surprised. This falls right in line with Trump’s ongoing attempts to project Maga Christianity on to the global stage and crack down on religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maga Christianity represents a self-serving, commercialized version of the Christian faith – putting power over service and empathy – and it is everywhere in our federal government. In February, Trump announced a taskforce led by Pam Bondi with the &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-signs-executive-orders-related-to-faith-announcement"&gt;goal of rooting out “anti-Christian” bias&lt;/a&gt;. In September, Trump announced his plans to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/08/trump-says-hell-direct-education-department-to-protect-praying-in-public-school-00550550"&gt;protect prayer in schools&lt;/a&gt;. Later that month, he issued a memorandum &lt;a href="https://time.com/7322106/trump-nspm-7-domestic-terrorism/"&gt;identifying anti-Christianity as a potential driver of terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. These are not just one-off incidents. This is a national effort to push the Maga Christianity agenda on Americans, and we’re already seeing the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doug Pagitt is executive director of Vote Common Good.

The basic answer probably touches on a few aspects of the 21st-century experience. One is the horror and conflict that seem to define the news almost every day. Another centres around the material pressures that increasingly grip supposedly peaceful countries: the never-ending cost of living crisis, and the impossibility for millions of people of a secure job, a dependable home and some halfway viable idea of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else demands a mention: the all-pervading mixture of absurdity, nastiness and anger fostered by the internet. Bigotry runs rampant. What we still rather laughably call social media now seem to operate on the basis that the ideal story mixes wildly improbable elements with the kicking-up of moral outrage (witness that ghoulish “online content creator” Bonnie Blue, who, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/29/1000-men-and-me-the-bonnie-blue-story-review-channel-4-documentary"&gt;having claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, ended the year by &lt;a href="https://spectator.com/article/i-stand-with-nigel-farage/"&gt;announcing her support&lt;/a&gt; for Nigel Farage).

It can’t happen soon enough&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the great joys of Christmas for me has been being able to share my love of The Nutcracker with my son. Last year, I took him to see a child-friendly version by the Let’s All Dance ballet company. The look of wonderment and recognition on his face when the music started up is a memory that I’ll treasure for ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll confess that the idea of taking a then two-year-old to a ballet had struck me as faintly ridiculous, one of those painfully middle-class-coded things I find myself doing as a parent (see also Mini Mozart). That kind of thinking, though, is in itself elitist, because who says ballet, or classical music, should be only for rarefied audiences? The popularity of The Nutcracker, not to mention shows such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/17/howard-blake-bill-alexander-snowman"&gt;The Snowman&lt;/a&gt;, which has been running at London’s Peacock theatre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/18/this-weeks-new-dance"&gt;28 years&lt;/a&gt;, is testament to how children respond joyfully, and instinctively, to dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

How can Britain ignore Beijing’s provocations and human rights abuses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK pushed hard to secure the release of Jimmy Lai, the newspaper publisher and British citizen who was a leading light in Hong Kong’s brutally suppressed pro-democracy movement. So, too, did press freedom and human rights campaigners. But the Beijing-appointed high court judges in the former colony convicted him anyway, finding Lai guilty last week on fake charges of trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-judges-national-security-charges"&gt;“destabilise” the Chinese Communist party&lt;/a&gt; (CCP). For Xi Jinping, China’s dictator-emperor, there is no greater crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesting to China’s ambassador, the UK’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/uk-condemns-hong-kongs-politically-motivated-targeting-of-jimmy-lai-after-conviction"&gt;condemned the trial&lt;/a&gt; as “politically motivated”. She’s right, of course – but her angry words will make no difference. Beijing’s contempt for Britain’s views is as painfully obvious as the UK’s weakness and indecision in the face of Chinese hubris.

Still, I’m convinced that I am the true spirit of the festive season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most families have their own unique festive rituals, and my husband and I have spent this December in the manner traditional to us: squabbling. He is fully invested in every possible aspect of the season of goodwill. On the big day itself, he wears his cracker crown until it breaks, like a metaphor; I usually don’t bother unfolding mine, let alone putting it on. We’ve been married for 15 years, and weathered many storms together, but at the moment our relationship is particularly challenging. How do you cope when you’re Christmas incompatible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my defence, I’m not bah-humbugging at merely a rational amount of yuletide spirit. My husband is perpetually jolly as standard – it’s always the first word anybody I introduce him to uses to describe him afterwards. He’s relentlessly cheerful, endlessly enthusiastic and can be relied upon to put a positive spin on any situation. If we were trapped in a burning building, the last words I’d hear would be, “At least we’re not cold!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What we know on day 1,397 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian drones hit an oil rig at Russia’s Filanovsky field in the Caspian Sea – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more than 700km (435 miles) from Ukraine’s nearest border&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as the military patrol ship Okhotnik and other facilities, Ukraine’s military general staff said in a statement on Saturday. It said the ship was patrolling near the platform. The extent of the damage was being assessed. The attack continues Kyiv’s recent campaign of &lt;strong&gt;strikes on Russia-linked maritime targets far from Ukrainian territory&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian drones struck a &lt;strong&gt;radar system in the Krasnosilske area of Crimea&lt;/strong&gt;, which Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine’s SBU security service claimed two Russian fighter jets were also destroyed at an airfield in occupied Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Thursday, Russian forces have at least five times hit a &lt;strong&gt;bridge on the Dniester River near the village of Mayaky&lt;/strong&gt;, south-west of Pivdennyi in Ukraine’s Odesa region, according to the deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba. The bridge, which connects parts of the region divided by the river and sea inlets, is the &lt;strong&gt;main transport route westward to border crossings with Moldova&lt;/strong&gt;, and is not operational now. The route &lt;strong&gt;accounted for about 40% of fuel supplies to Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, Kuleba said. Ukrainian authorities have set up a pontoon bridge and re-routed logistics through other regions, securing civilian and freight logistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;death toll rose to eight &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from a Russian strike on Pivdennyi port&lt;/strong&gt;. Geneva-based vegetable oil producer Allseeds said &lt;strong&gt;three tanks storing sunflower oil&lt;/strong&gt; at the site were set ablaze in Pivdennyi, and &lt;strong&gt;one of its workers was killed while two were injured&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military said its forces on Saturday &lt;strong&gt;fought back more than 60 attacks on Pokrovsk&lt;/strong&gt;, which is under heavy Russian siege. Across the combat zones in Ukraine, “the Russian invaders carried out 42 airstrikes, dropping 101 guided bombs. In addition, they used 1,684 kamikaze drones and carried out 2,467 attacks on our military positions and settlements.” In the Kharkiv region city of Izium, &lt;strong&gt;two people were killed by guided bomb strikes&lt;/strong&gt;, said the state emergency service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia reported &lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian drone attacks on its Belgorod region as well as an attack on facilities in the Kursk region&lt;/strong&gt; that left about 5,000 people without electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House offered to chair face-to-face talks between officials of the US, Russia and Ukraine, as the &lt;strong&gt;Trump administration continued to cast about for a peace deal&lt;/strong&gt;. “America is now proposing a trilateral meeting with national security advisers – America, Ukraine, Russia,” said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine would back the proposal, he said, if it facilitated more exchanges of prisoners and paved the way for meetings of national leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy said Ukraine stood for proposals that would leave the frontline where it is without Ukraine having to give up territory it still controls in the industrial region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. “For me, &lt;strong&gt;the fair version is we stand where we are now standing&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said. US negotiators met Russian officials in Florida on Saturday, following on from US talks on Friday with Ukrainian and European officials. It was suggested the talks would continue on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/21/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-oil-rig-hit-in-caspian-sea-over-700km-from-ukraine"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9808e8d5338af62df3dd89d1f74820165d5462e7/515_0_5883_4705/master/5883.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=cc0fc4e5fac1d35d68f7399dd4751fba" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Outrage and legal threats: Trump justice department slammed after limited Epstein files release</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/trump-justice-department-legal-threats-epstein-files-release</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/trump-justice-department-legal-threats-epstein-files-release</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:59:21 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers voice frustration over heavy redactions and the apparent removal of files from government website &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;’s justice department was hit with legal threats and scathing outrage after authorities released a limited, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-us-justice-department"&gt;heavily redacted trove&lt;/a&gt; of Jeffrey Epstein files in an apparent violation of the law mandating the near-complete disclosure of these documents by Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The justice department’s document dump this afternoon does not comply with Thomas Massie and my Epstein Transparency Act,” Ro Khanna, the California Democratic congressman who co-authored the law requiring full disclosure of all Epstein files by 19 December, said in &lt;a href="https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/2002150152690348438"&gt;a video statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/trump-justice-department-legal-threats-epstein-files-release"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61b2984b93810628bd47c0b7af1ab09000b0d249/514_429_3079_2464/master/3079.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=4430eb66f510c40c11a7bb9e77683c1a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>US intercepts second merchant vessel off coast of Venezuela in international waters</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/us-second-merchant-vessel-venezuela</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/us-second-merchant-vessel-venezuela</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 20:15:00 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Move comes days after Trump announces ‘blockade’ of sanctioned oil tankers and US seizes tanker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US forces on Saturday stopped a second merchant vessel off the coast of Venezuela in international waters, according to two US officials, the Associated Press reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes days after Donald Trump announced a “blockade” of all sanctioned oil tankers coming in to and out of the South American country and follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast"&gt;seizure&lt;/a&gt; by US forces of an oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast on 10 December.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/us-second-merchant-vessel-venezuela"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e21e05701712f4f06c3edce42d7dfb2a56de069/374_0_4302_3441/master/4302.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=90ff4bec0a55d0b5fcb7fea03927b3e1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Snails on a plane: Australia flies rescue mission to Norfolk Island for a tiny, critically endangered species</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/campbell-keeled-glass-snail-translocation-norfolk-island</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/campbell-keeled-glass-snail-translocation-norfolk-island</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 19:00:39 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The Campbell’s keeled glass-snail is officially extinct, but researchers have  ‘high hopes’ that translocation will allow the population to thrive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/sign-up-for-the-clear-air-australia-environment-newsletter-with-adam-morton?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;Sign up for climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s free Clear Air newsletter here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a grey day in early June, a commercial plane landed at Norfolk Island Airport in the South Pacific.

We are resuming our live coverage of the Department of Justice’s long-awaited release of documents from the federal investigations into &lt;strong&gt;Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/strong&gt;, the late sex offender who socialized with &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; for more than 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first cache of ‘Epstein Files’ were released on Friday evening after months of delay and stalling from the Trump administration. Deputy attorney general &lt;strong&gt;Todd Blanche&lt;/strong&gt; told Fox News that he expected the department to release several hundred thousand more files in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing documents &amp;amp; ‘over-redactions’:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khanna&lt;/strong&gt; said that the partial “document dump this afternoon does not comply” with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and told CNN, adding: “The most important documents are missing.” Those documents are a draft 60-count federal indictment outlining charges against Epstein, and a detailed memorandum summarizing the evidence that was disregarded by the US attorney, &lt;strong&gt;Alex Acosta&lt;/strong&gt;, who chose instead to offer Epstein an extraordinarily lenient plea deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/epstein-files-explode-open-doj-details-discovery-powerful-figures-more-than-1200-victims"&gt;a Fox News report&lt;/a&gt;, the justice department redacted the names and identifiers of victims and “the same redaction standards were applied to politically exposed individuals and government officials”. &lt;strong&gt;Massie&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2002176606664573208"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on social media that the attorney general, Pam Bondi, could be convicted by a future justice department of obstruction of justice if she violated a provision of the law by redacting the names of government officials. Massie noted that the law explicitly states that no documents may be “withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official”. &lt;strong&gt;Blanche&lt;/strong&gt; later called Fox News to insist that the justice department is “not redacting the names of any politicians”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the justice department said it may have “over-redacted” the Epstein files in order to “protect victims”. &lt;strong&gt;Jay Clayton&lt;/strong&gt;, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in court on Friday that it had blacked out the faces of almost every woman photographed with Jeffrey Epstein, citing issues determining who was a victim of the paedophile. Mr Clayton reportedly noted the approach could be “over-redaction”, but blamed it on the 30-day timeframe Congress set for releasing the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is in the Epstein files?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The files that were viewable included images of Epstein socialising with an array of prominent figures, including entertainers like &lt;strong&gt;Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Diana Ross,&lt;/strong&gt; and the entrepreneur &lt;strong&gt;Richard Branson&lt;/strong&gt;. The images also show former British royal &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor &lt;/strong&gt;and his ex-wife &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Ferguson&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Mandelson&lt;/strong&gt;, who was sacked from his job as the UK’s ambassador to the US earlier this year, could be seen in a picture with Epstein who is being presented with a giant birthday cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were many images of &lt;strong&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/strong&gt;, but very little about president Trump in the portion of the files released on Friday. But one seemingly innocuous snapshot of Epstein’s bookcase did include a reminder that he and Trump were once close. The image showed Epstein’s copy of Trump’s 1997 book, Trump: &lt;em&gt;The Art of the Comeback&lt;/em&gt;, which the New York Times&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/us/politics/trump-epstein-birthday-book.html"&gt; reported in July&lt;/a&gt; included an inscription from Trump reading: “To Jeff – You are the greatest!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/20/jeffrey-epstein-files-released-donald-trump-latest-news-photos-updates-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d0e4a8fad4832c116b12fd7e435bcba0a21271/321_366_2331_1864/master/2331.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a2692d51eac8b3412ff9ee7e66a4ce0c" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Each year, word of the year gets darker. ‘Six-seven’ may be annoying – but it’s bucked that trend | Coco Khan</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/20/words-of-the-year-six-seven-teenagers</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/20/words-of-the-year-six-seven-teenagers</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 10:00:26 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Some might regard it as ‘brain rot’, but the first word of the year just for tweens and teenagers could be the most hopeful development of 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What connects the word “vape”, the crying-laughing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/24/tears-of-joy-emoji-worst-gloat-about-human-suffering"&gt;emoji&lt;/a&gt; and the phrase “squeezed middle”?

Will they sit in the permanent collection, along with 2005’s “podcast” and 2015’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/05/binge-watch-2015-word-of-the-year-collins"&gt;binge-watch&lt;/a&gt;”?

The residents of the housing estates surrounding Battersea power station in London, including the Patmore where I was raised, faced that prospect when, in 2012, a consortium of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/07/battersea-power-station-preferred-bidders"&gt;Malaysian investors&lt;/a&gt; bought the derelict power station, decommissioned since 1983, for £400m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years earlier, David Cameron had launched the Conservative manifesto in the ruined power station.

Tourists buy mulled wine and churros at the Christmas market outside the Bourse, the old stock exchange, now repurposed as a beer museum. A few people drink coffee on cafe terraces. Up and down the length of the 650-metre-long space, people come and go, bikes and scooters weaving in and out of the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year, this scene will look somewhat different: bikes and scooters will be banned from this 18,000-sq-metre pedestrian zone for most of the day. People on two wheels will be allowed to ride only between 4am and 11am. At all other times, they must dismount and push their vehicle up the street, or face a fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/brussels-bike-ban-plan-for-pedestrian-zone-dangerous-and-absurd"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a632d575d4d9c6e53d44fffc8b7993e3e1b76254/0_58_3544_2836/master/3544.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=caf3cc379947b3d4a97dc13a8e1b1fca" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The volunteers putting their bodies between Israel settlers and a Palestinian village</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/the-volunteers-putting-their-bodies-between-israel-settlers-and-a-palestinian-village</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/the-volunteers-putting-their-bodies-between-israel-settlers-and-a-palestinian-village</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 07:00:25 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In the Jordan valley, teenage settlers drive herds of goats into a Palestinian community in a bid to force families out – volunteers are trying to hold the line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a daily onslaught.

Just don’t mention beef tomatoes or buffalo wings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of what you eat is sausages. I mean, if we’re going to get literal about it. Sausage derives from the Latin &lt;em&gt;salsicus&lt;/em&gt;, which means “seasoned with salt”. You might think of a sausage as a simple thing, but on this reading it is everything and nothing, a Borgesian meta-concept that retreats as you approach it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From another perspective, a sausage is an offal-filled intestine, or the macerated parts of an electrocuted or asphyxiated pig or other animal – generally parts that you wouldn’t knowingly eat – mixed with other ingredients that, in isolation, you might consider inedible. For some reason, it is seldom marketed as such.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/20/sausage-meat-lobby-europe-plant-based-name"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b2a57d265d6595899b0163100257d64ff58e207/0_600_2771_2217/master/2771.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=209ccde737a21de9e110fcabfeb393b5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Was 2025 the year that business retreated from net zero?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/20/was-2025-the-year-that-business-retreated-from-net-zero</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/20/was-2025-the-year-that-business-retreated-from-net-zero</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 05:00:20 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;From retailers to banks, carmakers to councils, the bold pledges for carbon-neutral economies are being watered down or scrapped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost a year since Donald Trump returned to the White House with a rallying cry to the fossil fuel industry to “drill baby, drill”, a backlash against net zero appears to be gathering momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More companies have retreated from, or watered down, their pledges to cut carbon emissions, instead prioritising shareholder returns over climate action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/20/was-2025-the-year-that-business-retreated-from-net-zero"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b09b001d3eef92a03e30674799947d7384f81b2/468_0_4680_3744/master/4680.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1c5443dd945a5c45f95b604919294d9f" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘From her pen sprang unforgettable females’: 16th-century Spanish author’s knight’s tale given reboot</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/16th-century-spanish-author-beatriz-bernal-knights-tale-given-reboot</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/16th-century-spanish-author-beatriz-bernal-knights-tale-given-reboot</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 05:00:21 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Beatriz Bernal’s pioneering novel features brave, chivalrous women who ride dragons and her adapter wants his illustrated version to reach young readers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty years before a gaunt and deluded nobleman from La Mancha was overdosing on tales of derring-do, visiting his madness on those around him – and single-handedly rewriting the rules of fiction – the deeds of another heroic knight had already made literary history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though completely eclipsed by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes"&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/a&gt;, Cristalián de España, which was first published in 1545, has a unique claim to fame.

What we know on day 1,396&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Russian missile attack late on Friday&lt;/strong&gt; on infrastructure around Ukraine’s Black Sea port of &lt;strong&gt;Pivdennyi in the Odesa region killed seven people and injured 15&lt;/strong&gt;, Ukrainian officials said. It comes after Ukraine said it had &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/ukraine-attacks-russian-shadow-tanker-off-libyan-coast"&gt;attacked a Russian “shadow fleet” tanker with aerial drones&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of Libya on Friday, in the first such strike in the Mediterranean since Moscow’s full-scale invasion. Odesa, a focal point of Ukrainian grain and other exports, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba said Ukraine was talking to Moldovan authorities to find alternative routes away from the affected area so trucks and passengers could cross the border. In Moldova, authorities set up temporary camps at border crossings to provide shelter and food for travellers making their way to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy said a &lt;strong&gt;€90bn loan from the EU to Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/ukraine-deal-latest-europe-leaders-loan-zelenskyy"&gt;that was secured on Friday&lt;/a&gt; to meet urgent financial needs amounted to “significant support that truly strengthens our resilience”, adding: “It is important that Russian assets remain immobilised and that Ukraine has received a financial security guarantee for the coming years.” The loan will last for two years and Kyiv would only repay it if and when Russia paid war reparations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin intends to capture all of Ukraine and reclaim parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire&lt;/strong&gt;, according to six sources familiar with US intelligence. The reports present a starkly different picture from that painted by Donald Trump and his Ukraine peace negotiators, who have said Putin wants to end the conflict. The most recent of the reports dates from late September, according to one of the sources. The intelligence also contradicts the Russian leader’s denials that he is a threat to Europe, and comes as Putin says “the ball is now fully and completely” in the court of Kyiv and its western allies regarding an end to the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US secretary of state, &lt;strong&gt;Marco Rubio, on Friday promised not to force Ukraine into any agreement to end Russia’s invasion&lt;/strong&gt; as European allies joined fresh talks in Miami. The weekend talks come as Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, in an annual news conference vowed to press ahead with his military offensive in Ukraine. Donald Trump’s envoys have pressed a plan in which the US would offer security guarantees to Ukraine, but Kyiv would likely be expected to surrender some territory. Rubio said both sides had to agree: “We can’t force Ukraine to make a deal. We can’t force Russia to make a deal. They have to want to make a deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubio said he may join the &lt;strong&gt;talks in Miami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on Saturday, which are being led by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt;, and will include top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov and officials from Britain, France and Germany. Umerov said he would be “acting clearly in line with the priorities defined by the [Ukrainian] president: security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin’s special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is also heading to Miami&lt;/strong&gt; to meet Witkoff and Kushner, a Russian source told Reuters. The source said that any meeting between Dmitriev and the Ukrainian negotiators had been ruled out. Witkoff and Kushner have been working with EU and Ukrainian negotiators on an amended version of a peace plan, earlier drafts of which were criticised by the EU and Ukraine as being slanted toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-missiles-strike-port-near-odesa-killing-seven-officials-say"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09de26b0adc285c583550cb7dab918ebeb9a3885/382_84_1495_1196/master/1495.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2a5c5d9175a84c15cb0fdade4441c65b" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Trump over-promises and under-delivers with heavily redacted Epstein cache</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/doj-epstein-files-release-redacted-trump</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/doj-epstein-files-release-redacted-trump</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 00:05:59 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;‘Most transparent’ administration has slow-walked and stonewalled – the incomplete release smells of a cover-up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-released-trump-administration"&gt;Epstein documents release – live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disappointment was palpable.

Pretending this is not happening is not good enough&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1981, IRA and other republican prisoners went on hunger strike in Northern Ireland, demanding the restoration of their political status. Ten would die; extraordinarily, their leader, Bobby Sands, had been elected as an MP by the time of his death. Margaret Thatcher took a hardline public stance. But by the end, behind the scenes, the government &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/04/northernireland.northernireland"&gt;was looking for an exit&lt;/a&gt;, and public opinion had shifted significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lives of the Palestine Action-affiliated remand prisoners &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/20/palestine-action-activists-awaiting-trial-in-prison-to-go-on-hunger-strike"&gt;now on hunger strike&lt;/a&gt; are at growing risk. On Friday, two reached day 48 without food. (In 1981, one IRA prisoner – 29-year-old Martin Hurson – died on the 46th day.) Twenty-year-old Qesser Zuhrah is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/16/palestine-action-hunger-strikers-may-die-without-lammy-intervention-lawyers-say"&gt;being treated in hospital&lt;/a&gt; after she reportedly collapsed at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey. Amu Gib, 30, has also been treated. Three more have refused food for more than 40 days and another, who has diabetes, is eating only every other day. Two others have now ended their protest, one after hospitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Among them, my own custom of devoting the last column before Christmas to reasons to be hopeful. In recent years, amid war and bloodshed, that task has been especially challenging – and this week was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began with the news from Bondi beach, where 15 people were gunned down and dozens more injured, most of them Jews celebrating the festival of Hanukah. That came just two-and-a-half months after &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/02/six-minutes-of-terror-how-manchester-synagogue-attack-unfolded"&gt;the deadly attack on Heaton Park synagogue&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester, on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur.

It is part of so-called “beaver bombing” across Europe over the last 25 years, a form of civil disobedience whereby people, frustrated at what they see as expensive, obstructive bureaucracy around species reintroduction, take matters into their own hands and release animals without engaging with conservation bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bureaucracy can be alternatively framed as necessary ecological safeguards. Curiously, beavers popping up in Britain, Spain, Belgium, Italy and elsewhere can all be genetically linked to the Bavarian population. We have good evidence that pine martens, polecats, wildcats and various amphibian and butterfly species have been released across the UK&amp;nbsp;without engagement with the&amp;nbsp;relevant authorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/19/the-rise-of-beaver-bombing-across-europe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61cbbd6e6ffb4d3064292b904fc6360ba2fa8fc3/219_0_2338_1871/master/2338.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=42a75e267e8210cfb81a0da6c431de41" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Unaccompanied children being pressed to return to their countries by US border officials</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/unaccompanied-children-trump-self-deport</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/unaccompanied-children-trump-self-deport</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Exclusive: federal document reveals children arriving as undocumented immigrants being threatened with detention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Border officials are pressuring unaccompanied children who arrive in the US as undocumented immigrants to quickly agree to return to their countries of origin, even if they express fear for their safety there – or else face “prolonged” detention and other consequences, a federal government document reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document, which emerged as an attachment in a court filing made by immigration attorneys, is understood to be presented or read to children within the first few days of them entering the US while they are still in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), before they can see any relatives in the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/unaccompanied-children-trump-self-deport"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473664ce8a9a033c7254ff69938d8a5bd5873df/331_781_4014_3212/master/4014.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=43e069ec3e43a408b07fe78702189ea1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Are sweet potatoes healthy?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/19/are-sweet-potatoes-healthy</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/19/are-sweet-potatoes-healthy</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;This holiday staple is also one of the world’s oldest crops – here’s what to know about adding sweet potatoes to your diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potatoes can be roasted, mashed, fried and pied – you might have eaten them so often that they feel old hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, they are – sweet potatoes count among the world’s oldest domesticated crops.

But not simply because racial intolerance has become newly contagious. It is because of a peculiarly British paradox: we abhor racists yet often excuse&amp;nbsp;racism because we too often want to believe that only&amp;nbsp;racists are capable of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But racism is no more dependent on racists for its existence than it is reliant on malice to find expression. Too few among the general public are cognisant of this and too many politicians appear to be ignorant of it, which is why so many can be wooed by a hardline anti-immigration stance without recognising the extent to which it employs racist tropes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/we-abhor-racism-in-britain-but-refuse-to-recognise-where-it-comes-from"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5a9bf60e0ea1bbd580260dec7728af4da58afa/799_0_6832_5464/master/6832.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0307c98b6a1f07de79be6f43ada55704" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Europe mustn’t build its own house of dynamite | Letters</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/europe-mustnt-build-its-own-house-of-dynamite</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/europe-mustnt-build-its-own-house-of-dynamite</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:12:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;A compelling model for sustainable security without nuclear deterrence or offensive military capabilities could be developed, writes &lt;strong&gt;Dr Ian Davis&lt;/strong&gt;.

To safeguard its security and values, Europe must act swiftly to prepare for a post‑Nato Europe. Most Europe-centric alternative proposals approach the issue from a traditional hard security perspective, not fully severing Nato ties but prioritising EU-led decision-making, often starting as a “Nato-plus” complement before evolving into a standalone entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such thinking also generally proposes major increases in military spending, an EU-based command structure independent of the US, integrated European military capabilities, a shared European nuclear deterrent, and binding mutual defence commitments.

I should know. When I was chief whip, nothing united a party quite as much as a defection. Old enemies call a truce from their daily hostilities to turn all the available ire on the traitor in their midst. Ask Shaun Woodward, the former Conservative MP for Witney &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/dec/19/labour.labour1997to99"&gt;who legged it to Labour in 1999&lt;/a&gt; while making all sorts of rather grand demands in the process. He was blackballed by his original party for such a flagrant act of opportunism, and hated by his new family as someone never to be entirely trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember the shock and anger when entering the chamber in April 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68913287"&gt;to see Dan Poulter seated uncomfortably behind Keir Starmer&lt;/a&gt; for PMQs. Not only had we had no warning, but as he had barely even attended parliament in anyone’s recent memory, we weren’t quite sure whether Labour would know who he was. Only weeks later, Dover diehard Natalie Elphicke &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/08/conservative-mp-natalie-elphicke-defects-to-labour-party"&gt;pulled the same stunt&lt;/a&gt; and also promptly disappeared from view. How she could have left friends and whips a few hours earlier with the impression that she was voting with the government that day, I am not quite sure&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It seems that such niceties matter little to the “defector community”, any more than loyalty to the party, volunteers, voters and supporters who gave them such a privileged position in the first place.

Turning her head could make her lightheaded or, worse, spark a devastating headache. She fought to remember basic daily tasks. Driving became impossible, as did the idea of continuing to work as a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at Buffalo Therapy Services, a clinic near her home in the suburb of East Aurora, New York, Buckley felt hopeful. For more than a year, she worked diligently with the clinic’s cognitive and occupational therapists. They took her into the darkened staff room and flashed red and green lasers so she could relearn the difference. They taught her to write everything down, to help with her lack of short-term memory. They made a list of what she wanted to accomplish, and told her: “We’re not going to work on what you can’t do any more. We’re going to work on what you can do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/19/healthcare-cuts-clinics-buffalo"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8c30ba0a8d67cc7894b6de3f1217b288b55fb5a/0_613_4757_3806/master/4757.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=3fcab7a943c5621669f8d3704a846f9d" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Revealed: FBI opened domestic terrorism investigations into anti-ICE activity across US</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/fbi-terrorism-investigations-anti-ice-activity</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/fbi-terrorism-investigations-anti-ice-activity</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:00:05 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Internal report shared with Guardian shows FBI has launched cases in 23 regions, some linked to Trump memo on thwarting ‘terroristic activities’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI has launched “criminal and domestic terrorism investigations” into “threats against immigration enforcement activity” in at least 23 regions across the US, according to an internal report shared with the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-page FBI document, dated 14 November, says some of the investigations are related to the “countering domestic terrorism” &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/trump-presidential-memorandum-political-violence"&gt;memo issued by Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/fbi-terrorism-investigations-anti-ice-activity"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a013038f680b595c81fd11efca424a31e7f711/479_0_6139_4912/master/6139.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=448f44afe71a9140944f51cc9a3ece84" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Like Maga disciples’: meet the Trump envoys raising eyebrows in Europe</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/trump-european-envoys-charles-kushner-andrew-puzder-stacey-feinberg-kimberly-guilfoyle</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/trump-european-envoys-charles-kushner-andrew-puzder-stacey-feinberg-kimberly-guilfoyle</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:07:56 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;US president has been blatant in his appointment of relatives, close friends and big donors – almost none of whom have diplomatic experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your goal is to “help Europe correct its current trajectory” because it is “weak”, “decaying” and facing “civilisational erasure”, your choice of highly trained operatives for the mission is plainly of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Donald Trump’s case they include: a former burger magnate; his eldest son’s former fiancee; the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team; a producer of Broadway musicals; PayPal’s co-founder; and a convicted felon who is also his son-in-law’s father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/trump-european-envoys-charles-kushner-andrew-puzder-stacey-feinberg-kimberly-guilfoyle"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4024c6238ac64e1ba0d0b9dfc4cb4ad3b94de58/431_0_4240_3392/master/4240.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8237457869cdde718ed0ad73322de071" medium="image"/></item><item><title>First Thing: Brown University shooting suspect died from self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials say</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/first-thing-brown-university-shooting-suspect-died-from-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound-officials-say</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/first-thing-brown-university-shooting-suspect-died-from-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound-officials-say</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:38:41 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Claudio Neves Valente, who was found dead in a storage facility, also killed an MIT professor.

Meanwhile, upstate New York and other parts of New England were on the colder side of the system and received significant snow accumulations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/19/weather-tracker-early-snowfall-new-york-storm-rips-down-lights-spain"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a10c34a7bc67bcf8f3b4e47ef75af19041acccc3/362_0_6830_5464/master/6830.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f39fe34c940d856060bdd69f2d8a0a74" medium="image"/></item><item><title>UK Foreign Office victim of cyber-attack in October, says Chris Bryant</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/19/uk-foreign-office-victim-cyber-attack-october-</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/19/uk-foreign-office-victim-cyber-attack-october-</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 08:00:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Minister says ‘any individual’ at low risk from hack, while Sun reports Chinese cyber gang responsible for breach &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office was hacked in October, the minister Chris Bryant has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant, a trade minister in Keir Starmer’s government, told Sky News there was a low risk to “any individual” from the cyber-attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/19/uk-foreign-office-victim-cyber-attack-october-"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3ccd425b125b2748a99b638f980b805674ad23e/395_0_3335_2668/master/3335.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c642ab8acb9769cbaed1c3d58fffd393" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Finally, Labour is finding its nerve and getting Britain’s bad Brexit deal undone | Polly Toynbee</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/19/labour-brexit-undone-finding-nerve-keir-starmer</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/19/labour-brexit-undone-finding-nerve-keir-starmer</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 08:00:55 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Rejoining Erasmus should just be a first step – as the economic evidence piles up, the need for closer ties with Europe could not be clearer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Month by month, Labour is bringing us closer to Europe.

Sign up here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rikki Held grew up on her family’s ranch in Montana, watching the land transform amid the climate crisis. The Powder River, which runs through the property, has sometimes dried up during drought, leaving crops and livestock without water. At other points, rapid snowmelt and heavy rains have caused flooding and eroded riverbanks, making the land difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the 24-year-old and a group of other young people won a groundbreaking legal victory, intended to prevent those impacts from worsening. In August 2023, a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/montana-climate-trial-young-activists-judge-order"&gt;ruled in favour&lt;/a&gt; of plaintiffs in Held v Montana, in which 16 young people accused the state of violating their constitutional rights by promoting planet-warming fossil fuels. The state’s supreme court affirmed the judge’s findings late last year, but plaintiffs say lawmakers have since passed new laws that violate that ruling. So last week, they &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/montana-climate-youth-activists-petition-law"&gt;filed a new petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on the supreme court to enforce their earlier win, one of several youth-led constitutional climate lawsuits filed in the US this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/13/a-shift-no-country-can-ignore-where-global-emissions-stand-10-years-after-the-paris-climate-agreement"&gt;‘A shift no country can ignore’: where global emissions stand, 10 years after the Paris climate agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/16/trauma-storm-hurricane-melissa-emotional-devastation-mental-health-ptsd-jamaica"&gt;The trauma after the storm: Hurricane Melissa leaves trail of emotional devastation across Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/10/synthetic-chemicals-food-system-health-burden-report"&gt;Synthetic chemicals in food system creating health burden of $2.2tn a year, report finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/montana-climate-youth-activists-petition-law"&gt;Montana youth activists who won landmark climate case push for court enforcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/trump-administration-fossil-fuels-climate"&gt;More than 40 Trump administration picks tied directly to oil, gas and coal, analysis shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/05/sunrise-movement-climate-activism-authoritarianism"&gt;Youth-led US climate activists widen focus to fight authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/18/as-the-us-invests-in-fossil-fuels-young-climate-activists-push-back-in-the-courts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ebde8f802264640a1fe0f7e6e0ee6622f28caae/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=571b5ae590b445833d815decdd4182e1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>UK borrowed more than expected in November amid pre-budget pressure</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/uk-government-borrowing-november-rachel-reeves-budget-economy</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/uk-government-borrowing-november-rachel-reeves-budget-economy</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 07:15:06 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;ONS figures show public sector net borrowing was £11.7bn – £1.9bn less than in same month last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK government borrowed more than expected in November, official figures show, amid pressure on the economy before chancellor Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net borrowing – the difference between spending and income – was £11.7bn last month, £1.9bn less than in the same month a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/uk-government-borrowing-november-rachel-reeves-budget-economy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621ea97f7087f9c8eba79a9ef19268192631b239/1113_0_3966_3173/master/3966.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e47d53f65c76132b50096ca069b5d7a3" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Reeves to Ryanair: Take the Guardian’s Christmas business quiz</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/reeves-to-ryanair-take-the-guardians-christmas-business-quiz</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/reeves-to-ryanair-take-the-guardians-christmas-business-quiz</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:00:56 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know your Tesla from your Jaguar?

Belgian prime minister &lt;strong&gt;Bart De Wever&lt;/strong&gt; said as the summit wrapped up that he believed “rationality has prevailed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;German chancellor Friedrich Merz had pushed hard for using Russia’s frozen assets but still said the final decision on the EU-backed loan “sends a clear signal&lt;/strong&gt;” to Vladimir Putin. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Ukraine would need to repay the loan only once Moscow paid for the damages it has caused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, agreed not to block&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the loan to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years&lt;/strong&gt; as long as his country, Slovakia and the Czech Republic were excluded from the guarantees for the debt. The deal would not affect the financial obligations of the three countries, which did not want to contribute to the financing of Ukraine, a text said on the agreement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy had urged EU leaders at the start of the summit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to use the frozen Russian assets&lt;/strong&gt;, saying: “It’s moral, it’s fair, it’s legal.” The EU estimates Ukraine needs an extra €135bn to stay afloat over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Washington, Donald Trump urged Ukraine to move swiftly on a peace deal ahead of fresh talks expected in Miami&lt;/strong&gt;. The US president told reporters in the Oval Office: “Well, they’re getting close to something, but I hope Ukraine moves quickly. I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there. And you know, every time they take too much time, then Russia changes their mind.” Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner plan to meet Russian officials in Florida this weekend, a White House official said, after the envoys held talks with a Ukrainian delegation in Berlin last Sunday and Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;With agencies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/19/ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-european-union-agreement-90bn-loan-deal-kyiv"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8493b00027ba31499f55a04e03aeea074669f5c/117_0_3463_2771/master/3463.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b8c3a7ad8498f151b2b3560db6919842" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Friday briefing: Why the search for Britain’s missing TV is running out of time</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/friday-briefing-why-the-search-for-britains-missing-tv-is-running-out-of-time</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/friday-briefing-why-the-search-for-britains-missing-tv-is-running-out-of-time</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:50:36 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: From Quatermass to Doctor Who, so much early television has vanished – and as film degrades and collectors age, the chances of recovering what remains are shrinking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. We take it for granted in 2025 that anything we watch on Christmas Day will soon be on a streaming platform, or end up on a pristine Blu-ray release. That was very much not the case in the early decades of British television. Programmes were often treated as fleeting stage productions rather than archival objects, and when recordings &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; made, tapes were often wiped or film reels junked, leaving frustrating gaps in our cultural memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I spent a day at Derby Quad which is devoted to Nigel Kneale’s pioneering Quatermass stories, and spoke to actor, writer and comedian &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toby Hadoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This newsletter is about the enduring appeal of seeking out these lost fragments in time, why certain programmes still cast such a long shadow, and why our chances of recovering missing episodes may now be running out. But first, here are the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| EU leaders have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/ukraine-deal-latest-europe-leaders-loan-zelenskyy"&gt;pledged a €90bn loan for Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; to meet urgent financial needs, but failed to agree on the preferred option for many of securing that loan against Russia’s frozen assets in the bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Boys as young as 11 who show &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/17/teachers-will-be-given-extra-training-to-tackle-misogyny-in-schools"&gt;misogynistic behaviour&lt;/a&gt; will be taught the difference between pornography and real relationships, as part of a multimillion pound investment to tackle misogyny in English schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The Bank of England has cut &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-375"&gt;interest rates to 3.75%,&lt;/a&gt; giving a pre-Christmas boost to the UK’s struggling economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US news &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Democrats have released &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-estate-files-photos"&gt;a new batch of photos&lt;/a&gt; from the estate of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, among them photographs of what appear to be lines from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sport &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| A full-throated “Rory roar” reverberated around MediaCity in Salford as Rory McIlroy became the first golfer in 36 years t&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/18/rory-mcilroy-bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-golf"&gt;o win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award&lt;/a&gt; – and tie a bow on a year for the ages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/friday-briefing-why-the-search-for-britains-missing-tv-is-running-out-of-time"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bf4a5fd3965b6a4abc3ce869b50d58191be0617/130_108_1301_1041/master/1301.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d8455c9664fc6da3f79dfd2a1d8a762d" medium="image"/></item><item><title>US strikes two more alleged drug boats, bringing death toll to over 100</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/us-venezuela-alleged-drug-boats-strikes-pacific-death-toll-increases</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/us-venezuela-alleged-drug-boats-strikes-pacific-death-toll-increases</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:38:23 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;US military declares five alleged drug traffickers killed in Pacific Ocean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US military said it killed on Thursday five more alleged drug traffickers aboard two vessels in the Pacific Ocean, bringing the divisive campaign’s death toll to over 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; has carried out such strikes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September but has provided no evidence that the boats are involved in drug trafficking, prompting debate about the operations’ legality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/us-venezuela-alleged-drug-boats-strikes-pacific-death-toll-increases"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58f6098a331f8b6ceaca62f7ec36e25b6eef133/209_559_790_632/master/790.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8710cdde9d43a315fb67af0b436daaf8" medium="image"/></item><item><title>UK’s largest proposed datacentre ‘understating planned water use’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/19/uk-largest-proposed-data-centre-planned-water-use-northumberland</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/19/uk-largest-proposed-data-centre-planned-water-use-northumberland</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:00:52 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Analysis suggests consumption at Northumberland site could be 50 times higher than US operator QTS estimates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK’s largest proposed datacentre is understating the scale of its planned water use, according to an analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first phase of construction for the hyperscale campus in Cambois in Northumberland has been given the go-ahead by the local council.

As I listened, it struck me that, while Europe’s role in the Middle East has been severely damaged by its immoral stance on the Gaza war and its self-inflicted exclusion from Iran nuclear diplomacy, Europeans still have a role to play when it comes to its neighbours in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe’s world has been turned upside down by Washington’s alignment with Moscow in the Ukraine war and the transatlantic rift as the Trump administration treats Europe as an adversary. Another dimension of this upheaval is Europe’s growing irrelevance in the Middle East. Only if Europeans accept that the past is behind them can they hope to regain a constructive independent role in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/19/europe-middle-east-syria-iraq-lebanon-donald-trump"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d890db46796f4dae286189a723f769ed4a603df/663_0_6380_5103/master/6380.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=dc8aa175b97d7a49ad8a5ae3e61496f2" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Thrillers should be on UK school curriculum to boost reading, says Lee Child</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/19/lee-child-thrillers-uk-school-curriculum-literacy</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/19/lee-child-thrillers-uk-school-curriculum-literacy</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:00:52 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author says focus on ‘masterpieces’ puts children off as he promotes prison literacy scheme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much of the literature taught in UK schools is putting children off reading and thrillers should become part of the curriculum, one of the world’s biggest selling authors has argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/07/jack-reacher-author-lee-child-more-sex-is-medically-implausible-and-im-as-rich-and-famous-as-i-need-to-be"&gt;Lee Child, the British writer of Jack Reacher novels&lt;/a&gt;, which have sold more than 100m copies worldwide, said: “I can totally understand why, if you’re an English teacher and you’ve read all your life and you love this stuff and you’ve been to university, then you want to introduce the big, major masterpieces.

Experts are raising the alarm on a complex crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the southern Peloponnese, the Greek fir is a towering presence. The deep green, slow-growing conifers have long defined the region’s high-altitude forests, thriving in the mountains and rocky soils. For generations they have been one of the country’s hardier species, unusually capable of withstanding drought, insects and the wildfires that periodically sweep through Mediterranean ecosystems. These Greek forests have lived with fire for as long as anyone can remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when Dimitrios Avtzis, a senior researcher at the Forest Research Institute (FRI) of Elgo-Dimitra, was dispatched to document the aftermath of a spring blaze in the region, nothing about the assignment seemed exceptional.

What we know on day 1,395&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hungary’s Viktor Orbán has agreed not to block&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/ukraine-deal-latest-europe-leaders-loan-zelenskyy"&gt;a massive EU-backed interest-free loan to Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years&lt;/strong&gt;, as long as his country, Slovakia and the Czech Republic were excluded from the guarantees for the debt. After failing to agree on using frozen Russian assets, diplomats announced the new loan in the early hours of Friday. The deal will not affect the financial obligations of Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which did not want to contribute to the financing of Ukraine, the text said. Moscow-friendly Hungary had previously said it would oppose the deal, just as it opposed the use of Russian assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Ukraine would have to repay the loan only if &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; paid reparations for its war&lt;/strong&gt;, and that the EU reserved the right to use Russian assets immobilised in the EU for repayment if Russia failed to pay compensation. Merz had pushed hard for the frozen asset plan – but still said the final decision on the loan “sends a clear signal” to Russian president Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The move follows hours of discussions among leaders on the technical details of a loan based on the frozen Russian assets, which turned out to be too complex or politically demanding to sort out at this stage&lt;/strong&gt;, diplomats said. “We have gone from saving Ukraine to saving face, at least that of those who have been pushing for the use of the frozen assets,” one EU diplomat said. The main difficulty in the use of the Russian money was providing Belgium, where €185bn ($217bn) of the total €210bn of Russian assets in Europe are held, with sufficient guarantees against financial and legal risks from potential Russian retaliation for the release of the money to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump has urged Ukraine to move “quickly” on a deal to end Russia’s invasion ahead of fresh talks expected in Miami at the weekend&lt;/strong&gt;. The US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday on a potential settlement: “Well, they’re getting close to something, but I hope Ukraine moves quickly. I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there. And you know, every time they take too much time, then Russia changes their mind.” Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner plan to meet Russian officials in Florida for the talks, a White House official said, after the envoys met a Ukrainian delegation in Berlin last Sunday and Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Danish government has accused Russia of being behind two “destructive and disruptive” cyber-attacks in what it describes as “very clear evidence” of a hybrid war,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/denmark-says-russia-was-behind-two-destructive-and-disruptive-cyber-attacks"&gt;reports Miranda Bryant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The Danish Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) announced on Thursday that Moscow was behind a cyber-attack on a Danish water utility in 2024 and a series of distributed denial-of-service attacks on Danish websites in the lead-up to municipal and regional council elections in November. A DDIS statement cited Russia’s “hybrid war against the west” and said: “The aim is to create insecurity in the targeted countries and to punish those that support Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian strikes near Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa on Thursday killed a woman in her car and hit infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; and the regional governor asked residents suffering long power cuts to stop blocking roads in protest. Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that a Russian drone killed a woman crossing a bridge in her car south-west of Odesa. Her three children were injured.

Big changes in policing and the courts are needed too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour set itself a mammoth task when it pledged, before last year’s election, to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/12/labour-strategy-tackling-violence-against-women-tories"&gt;halve violence against women and girls&lt;/a&gt; (VAWG) in 10 years. While many forms of crime have decreased over the past decade, sexual assault has not. In the year to March 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingjune2025#sexual-offences"&gt;1.9% of people&lt;/a&gt; in England and Wales experienced&amp;nbsp;it, and &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/sexualoffencesinenglandandwalesoverview/march2022"&gt;82%&lt;/a&gt; of victims were female. The&amp;nbsp;prevalence of image-related offences has risen sharply. So has concern about the impact on young men of violent pornography and influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this grim backdrop, and the fiscal constraints under which the government has chosen to operate, it is no wonder that the promised VAWG strategy was delayed. This is a societal issue that does&amp;nbsp;not sit neatly in one government department. Jess&amp;nbsp;Phillips is the minister responsible at the Home Office. But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/17/teachers-will-be-given-extra-training-to-tackle-misogyny-in-schools"&gt;education&amp;nbsp;and justice reforms&lt;/a&gt; are also essential if aims&amp;nbsp;are to be met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just when you thought BP was trying to generate less drama, the new chair has decided a new chief executive is needed. Say goodbye to Murray Auchincloss, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/26/bp-oil-and-gas-spending-green-energy-scale-back"&gt;who junked the green-ish transition strategy&lt;/a&gt; of his predecessor as recently as February. Meg O’Neill, the American boss of the Australian group Woodside Energy, becomes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive"&gt;BP’s first outside hire as chief executive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At face value, a new appointment should not be an outright surprise. Albert Manifold arrived as BP chair in July and, after the many flip-flops under &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/feb/11/time-for-bps-chair-to-head-for-the-exit"&gt;the ineffectual Helge Lund&lt;/a&gt;, he had a mandate to take his own view of how the company should be managed. If he and the board think an injection of “increased rigour and diligence” is necessary to fulfil the new oilier plan, fair enough. The activist investor Elliott may have been urging much the same. Even Auchincloss recognised the possibility he could be axed. His statement said he had told Manifold of his “openness to step down” if a new leader was identified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/dec/18/bp-opts-for-culture-shock-with-new-ceo-appointment-but-the-timing-is-odd"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d7cf0d1f17d8fc5ed8f0ef17c27ddea486b0397/677_0_3745_2995/master/3745.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=57817462515d2105e08e657951ef110a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Democrats release new Epstein photos ahead of DoJ transparency deadline</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-estate-files-photos</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-estate-files-photos</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 18:11:03 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Images, undated and uncaptioned, include Vladimir Nabokov lines written on women and show Bill Gates and Noam Chomsky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/18/us-politics-live-venezuela-russia-strikes-trump-news-updates"&gt;US politics – live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-files-department-of-justice"&gt;What we know so far about the Epstein files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; on the House oversight committee have released a new batch of photos from the estate of convicted sex offender, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein"&gt;Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, as the deadline for the justice department to release its files related to Epstein looms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The images, released on Thursday, are undated and lack captions or context.

The problem is that its enemies will never see it that way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morally, the decision facing the European Council in Brussels this week has been a no-brainer. Russia invaded Ukraine illegally and unilaterally. Moscow shows no sign of wanting peace. It actively threatens other countries too, including Britain. Ukraine is running out of money. Yet &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/arguments-frozen-russian-assets-support-ukraine"&gt;£184bn worth&lt;/a&gt; of Russian assets &lt;a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/reparations-loan-where-russias-frozen-assets-are-held-across-the-eu/"&gt;remain frozen&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, notably in Belgium. That money should therefore be mobilised to fund Ukraine. To many, this would be the enactment of a&amp;nbsp;clear and present duty, proof positive that Europe can still be a heavy hitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the messy reaches of the real world, however, things have not been straightforward. Law, economics and politics all managed to insinuate themselves, sometimes venomously, into the intense buildup to Brussels. Reparations can have lethal political consequences. Seizure of assets will undoubtedly face&amp;nbsp;legal challenge. It is also bitterly opposed by Donald Trump, who wants the unfreezing of assets to form a key part of his pro-Russian peace plan. Mr&amp;nbsp;Trump is pressing hard for a quick deal, and US and&amp;nbsp;Russian negotiators are poised to meet again in Miami at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/18/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-and-ukraine-a-moment-of-truth-for-brussels-and-kyiv"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/694f03b6940776525c78ec0c161f667a272c0cbd/683_0_4050_3241/master/4050.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a326d85ac508babdec1d6fbf06f59e9b" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Money today or blood tomorrow’: EU leaders race to secure deal for Ukraine</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/eu-leaders-summit-funding-deal-for-ukraine</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/eu-leaders-summit-funding-deal-for-ukraine</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 17:38:51 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Summit divided on idea of loan secured against Russian assets, as Belgium seeks guarantees if scheme goes wrong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/belgian-politicians-finance-bosses-targeted-russian-intelligence-seized-assets"&gt;Belgian politicians and finance bosses targeted by Russian intelligence over seized assets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU leaders are racing to secure a funding deal for Ukraine that has been cast as a choice between “money today or blood tomorrow”, but Belgium continues to oppose a loan secured against Russia’s frozen assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a summit billed as make or break, EU leaders are discussing an unprecedented move to tap some of Russia’s €210bn sovereign assets frozen in the bloc days after the full-scale invasion of 2022.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/eu-leaders-summit-funding-deal-for-ukraine"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e606f8f96a99d4f1476eb390d790cf3f8593394/0_258_3941_3150/master/3941.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=16f8a05305aa6652b8ab996e3f4550b6" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Don’t weaken health and safety rules in the name of growth | Letter</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/18/dont-weaken-health-and-safety-rules-in-the-name-of-growth</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/18/dont-weaken-health-and-safety-rules-in-the-name-of-growth</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 17:09:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Wilkinson &lt;/strong&gt;says good regulation allows business to thrive without risking workers’ health &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Fingleton’s claim that health and safety rules are holding UK infrastructure back (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/12/health-and-safety-rules-holding-uk-infrastructure-back-says-writer-of-government-report"&gt;Report, 12&amp;nbsp;December&lt;/a&gt;) is not only wrong, it’s dangerous. Stripping back protections in the name of speed is a false economy that risks lives, reputations and resilience. The UK’s health and safety framework is the backbone of safe and sustainable growth. These regulations have driven a historic decline in workplace fatalities, injuries and ill health. Weakening them would reverse decades of progress and shift enormous costs on to the NHS, employers and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the progress, &lt;a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/fatals-overview.htm"&gt;124 people died&lt;/a&gt; in accidents at work in 2024-25. In 2023-24, the estimated annual cost of workplace injuries and new cases of work-related ill health reached £22.9bn. Good regulation allows businesses to thrive without compromising worker health and safety. The idea that deregulation will unlock growth ignores the reality – unsafe work slows projects, causes harm and damages reputations. We urge policymakers to reject calls for health and safety deregulation, and uphold the world-class standards that make Britain a safe, healthy and competitive place to work, trade and invest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Wilkinson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head of policy and public affairs, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institution of Occupational Safety and Health &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Surely, I don’t have to tell you that such quaint human emotions as “happiness” and “hope” are in short supply these days. This year, of all years, no one should be blamed for plugging their ears any time Mariah Carey comes on in the lobby of the unemployment office. And yet, we carry on with the rituals of joy that seem more and more incongruous, when life feels like some never-ending episode of MTV’s Ridiculousness, where God comments on clips of the human race getting hit in the face with a plastic baseball bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m certainly making an effort to put on a pleasant facade.

Last month, Congress passed the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text"&gt;Epstein Files Transparency Act&lt;/a&gt;, which required the release of those materials by 19 December, except in narrow cases where they would jeopardize current investigations, harm national security or foreign policy goals, or reveal information about Epstein’s victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Trump signed the legislation, his administration has been silent on its progress. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers asked Pam Bondi, the attorney general, for a briefing on the department of justice’s progress, but she did not provide one. Two Democratic senators among that group &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/democrats-epstein-files-pam-bondi"&gt;subsequently pledged&lt;/a&gt; to block some civilian nominees, because they were concerned the administration “is gearing up to disregard the law we led the fight in the Senate to pass, which overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-files-department-of-justice"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2b8259535177027e87a39e06f382f8a98cafeac/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fdf71cd367ab6c6c8cdfda413d4d44fa" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Bank of England cuts interest rates to 3.75% in pre-Christmas boost for struggling economy</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-375</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-375</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 12:00:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Rate-setters back quarter-point cut after steep fall in inflation and weak economic data but vote remained close&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-interest-rates-cut-inflation-economy-stock-markets-business-live-news-updates"&gt;Business live – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England has cut interest rates by a quarter point, delivering a pre-Christmas boost to the struggling UK economy, but a split vote among its rate-setters pointed to continued concerns about inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) opted by five votes to four to reduce its key base rate from 4% to 3.75%, signalling that it now expects inflation to be “closer” to the 2% target in the first quarter of the new year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-375"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993b1fe216a5defc979f654013b754ec0067cb1a/428_0_4267_3415/master/4267.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=4ce56ca96df3fdb5ce162f51b0ef4c6b" medium="image"/></item><item><title>UN distances itself from International Women’s Day website winning corporate partnerships</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/international-womens-day-website-owned-london-pr-firm-not-linked-to-un</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/international-womens-day-website-owned-london-pr-firm-not-linked-to-un</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 12:45:41 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Sainsbury’s, Barclays and University College London have all drawn on themes created by IWD site run by London business with no link to UN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody owns &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/international-womens-day"&gt;International Women’s Day&lt;/a&gt;, but if you asked the 193 countries, countless businesses and NGOs that mark it each year, they would probably agree it has been popularised, defined and formalised by the &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of the website “internationalwomensday.com”, a London-based marketing firm, disagrees.

His famous fake tan is a bit more sallow than usual and seems painted on more thickly and clumsily than it was before. He appears to nod off in front of cameras more and more often, including in cabinet meetings and press events in the Oval Office. His public schedule &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/us/politics/trump-age-health.html"&gt;is light&lt;/a&gt;: he is often at his golf clubs, has traveled around the country less frequently than at this point in his first term, and now only rarely holds the stadium rallies that once defined his preferred style of politics. He tends to sit, even when others are standing, and has shortened his daily schedule, often not conducting official duties before noon. A New York Times report found that his public appearances have declined by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/us/politics/trump-age-health.html"&gt;nearly 40%&lt;/a&gt; compared to his first year in office. He sometimes disappears from public view for days as he did in the late summer, and he and his administration have released unclear and conflicting information about his health. His right hand seems to be experiencing frequent injury or discoloration – it will often be covered with a band-aid or smeared with makeup; the White House has claimed, implausibly, that he is bruised from shaking too many hands.

The government is finally publishing its violence against women and girls (VAWG) strategy. In its manifesto Labour said it wanted to halve VAWG within a decade, and so this is a vital policy area. Publication of the strategy has been delayed three times. In the Commons on Monday, in response to an urgent question on this, Jess Phillips, minister for safeguarding and VAWG, said the delays were down to her. “It is entirely my fault because, with every iteration, the strategy was not ambitious enough. I could have done it more quickly, and then it would not have been as good,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the document is being published today, the VAWG strategy is being promoted via a budget-style, week-long media strategy. We have already had announcements form the Home Office covering &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/over-1-billion-for-victims-of-domestic-abuse-to-access-support-and-rebuild-their-lives"&gt;extra spending for abuse victims&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/abuse-victims-to-get-specialist-nhs-support"&gt;specialist NHS help for abuse victims&lt;/a&gt;, and all police forces introducing &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-vawg-strategy-will-leave-offenders-with-nowhere-to-hide"&gt;specialist rape and sexual offence teams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit sick, I have to say, as somebody who’s campaigned on this for many years, of just trying to put nicer plasters onto ever growing scars, and so we’ve got to – the government is really, really focused on the prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the success of this strategy hinges on whether delivery partners are equipped to succeed. Early indications around funding are deeply concerning. The strategy introduces welcome measures in schools and the NHS which will, by design, drive up disclosures and referrals to police and victim services. Yet frontline services are already overstretched and struggling to meet need, and the criminal justice system remains in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding is critical. Driving up demand without increasing capacity puts victims at risk and threatens to destabilise the very partners the strategy relies upon. This concern is heightened by the lack of meaningful consultation. Victim services are not an optional extra to this strategy - they must be the backbone of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/dec/18/violence-women-girls-strategy-labour-conservatives-badenoch-starmer-latest-news-updates"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85aac2387882f9da78e012c3a70388532b91d2c4/715_0_4467_3574/master/4467.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=dd593dfdf9920e887a26bf9402460627" medium="image"/></item><item><title>French court finds ‘twisted’ anaesthetist guilty of killing 12 patients</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/french-court-finds-twisted-anaesthetist-frederic-pechier-guilty-killing-12-patients</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/french-court-finds-twisted-anaesthetist-frederic-pechier-guilty-killing-12-patients</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 09:44:54 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Former top medic described as ‘Dr Death’ by prosecutors poisoned 30 people ranging in age from four to 89&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/08/france-anaesthetist-frederic-pechier-trial-accused-of-intentionally-poisoning-patients"&gt;French anaesthetist&lt;/a&gt; described by prosecutors as “Dr Death” has been found guilty of intentionally poisoning 30 patients and killing 12 over almost a decade as a top medic in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frédéric Péchier, 53, once seen by colleagues as a “star anaesthetist”, was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday after state prosecutors said he was “one of the biggest criminals in the history of the French legal system”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/french-court-finds-twisted-anaesthetist-frederic-pechier-guilty-killing-12-patients"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2e06ced3c2138c88f3ded576db167ad8435b1ce/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=452f1d45da0f254e92320f85a987ac8e" medium="image"/></item><item><title>How many big names have paid the price for being linked to Jeffrey Epstein?

That says as much as the scandal itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, the annual DealBook Summit got under way in New York. It’s a series of public talks billed as conversations with “the world’s most consequential people”, and is part of that circuit of live events in which the worst people on Earth gather on stage to address the second-worst people on Earth, their paying audience. Hosted by Andrew Ross Sorkin, the conference was a characteristically starry affair, but in a lineup that included Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and “changemaker” Halle Berry, it was Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel and a former associate of Jeffrey Epstein, who really caught the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first thought about Barak’s appearance was: Larry Summers must be spitting. Summers, the former president of Harvard and another &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/19/larry-summers-harvard-epstein"&gt;Epstein associate&lt;/a&gt;, was very much not on stage at the DealBook Summit, nor is he anywhere else in polite society right now. One can only imagine how bitter he must be feeling about the variance in fortunes of the men – and occasional woman – with known connections to Epstein. Of this list, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/books/review/virginia-roberts-giuffre-nobodys-girl-memoir.html"&gt;two are dead&lt;/a&gt; (Marvin Minsky and Jean-Luc Brunel), one is in jail (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell"&gt;Ghislaine Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;) and one has lost his house, his title and his invitation to the family Christmas (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/15/former-prince-andrew-is-butt-of-the-years-best-christmas-cracker-joke"&gt;Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor&lt;/a&gt;). But for the rest of the prominent associates, email correspondents, birthday-card signatories, grant recipients and dinner companions of the late convicted paedophile – all of whom insist that, while in Epstein’s orbit, they remained in total ignorance as to the man’s true nature – the cancellation fairy’s aim has been predictably inconsistent and wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Richard Pearson is visiting Surrey to close down his late father’s home and settle his affairs and, everywhere he looks, the flag of St George is flying “from suburban gardens and filling stations and branch post offices”. How nice, he thinks, how festive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Soon he learns the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So runs the opening not of a recent piece of journalism, but a novel by JG Ballard, Kingdom Come, which despite being almost 20 years old anticipates today’s Britain with eerie precision. In the mid-2000s, Pearson reads up on his new surroundings, only to find the same headlines that assail us in the mid-2020s: “Every day the local newspaper reported attacks on an asylum hotel, the torching of a Bangladeshi takeaway, injuries to a Kosovan youth thrown over the fence into an industrial estate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/18/sickness-britain-novel-20-years-ago-jg-ballard"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1d5476829d563e1c79c77722404b7e709b1e0ab/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e711cddefc5c2e3266bd17e1a00979ad" medium="image"/></item><item><title>BP names Meg O’Neill as new CEO after incumbent ousted</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 08:18:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;O’Neill, who has led Woodside Energy since 2021, will be oil and gas company’s first female chief executive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP’s board has appointed its first female chief executive in a move to revive the oil company’s fortunes, after ousting Murray Auchincloss less than two years into his role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unexpected leadership shake-up, Auchincloss will step down as chief executive with immediate effect, but remain in an advisory role until the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1b93a106ace7dffe831d6e1a99a5ae738516dc/424_0_3675_2940/master/3675.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c2924ca9426ceade759dc923ed5a2d85" medium="image"/></item><item><title>EU told to choose between ‘money today or blood tomorrow’ as leaders debate giving Russian assets to Ukraine – Europe live</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/18/eu-frozen-russian-assets-ukraine-war-europe-latest-news-updates</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/18/eu-frozen-russian-assets-ukraine-war-europe-latest-news-updates</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 08:30:43 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;European leaders meet in Brussels as Poland’s Donald Tusk issues warning to fellow EU states&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief opponent of sending any further money to Ukraine, Hungary’s &lt;strong&gt;Viktor Orbán, &lt;/strong&gt;just told reporters in Brussels that the idea of using frozen Russian assets was “stupid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;The whole idea is stupid&lt;/strong&gt;. … There are two countries which are at war – it’s not European Union, [it’s] Russia and Ukraine – and the European Union would like to take away the money of one of the warring party and then to give it to another one. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s marching into the war.

That’s where leadership comes in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you listen to a Christmas performance of Handel’s Messiah, it is easy to persuade yourself that all is still well with music and the arts in Britain. I again felt the familiar potency of both Messiah and of music more widely in London’s St Martin’s-in-the-Fields on Tuesday this week. When the musicians and singers launched into the fabulously affirmative final chorus, Worthy is the Lamb, towards which Handel and his librettist Charles Jennens have all along been building, the annual ritual poured forth Messiah’s deep sense of shared security and allayed doubt afresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been going to Messiah at Christmas for decades now, at one venue or another, and the experience never ceases to lift the spirits in this darkest of seasons. This year, though, more disturbing feelings were also in play. The tender balm of Messiah’s opening lines for the tenor – “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people” – has rarely sounded more necessary and consolatory than it did this week.

While the Greek word &lt;em&gt;krisis&lt;/em&gt; refers to an exceptional moment that disrupts the normal order of things, since 2015 it has become an &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02637758231152478"&gt;enduring condition&lt;/a&gt; in contemporary Europe. That year, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35158769"&gt;1 million people&lt;/a&gt; sought refuge in Europe, fleeing wars and persecution. In the ensuing decade, the issue of migration has been so thoroughly weaponised that one can hardly remember a time when it was not considered &lt;a href="https://portolan-journal.org/?post=punitive-environments-and-the-antiimmigration-authoritarian-commonsense"&gt;a crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of a permanent state of emergency does not reflect a reality whereby Europe genuinely cannot cope with new arrivals.

It was July and Wimbledon had started. “He said: ‘We want you to go down and get into the women’s changing rooms and report on lesbian behaviour.’ One didn’t normally swear at that time but I declined. That was the attitude then,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the late 1960s until the early 70s, Brayfield was one of a small group of female journalists working on women’s pages in newspapers. “We were dealing with everyday sexism on an unbelievable scale,” she said. “You learned to wear trousers or take the lift because if you took the stairs someone would try to look up your skirt. But then you couldn’t go to a lot of press conference venues in trousers. In the Savoy, for example, women in trousers weren’t allowed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/pretty-birds-and-silly-moos-the-women-behind-the-sex-discrimination-act"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24e4e7b1ccd469d5e45ba6ee35d068075ce29dfd/484_0_4349_3480/master/4349.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5a2e3c538b4f35fcd0f45d178d0d8240" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘It’s an open invasion’: how millions of quagga mussels changed Lake Geneva for ever</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/18/invasive-quagga-mussels-lake-geneva-aoe</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/18/invasive-quagga-mussels-lake-geneva-aoe</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 05:00:29 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The molluscs are decimating food chains in Switzerland, have devastated the Great Lakes in the US, and this week were spotted in Northern Ireland for the first time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like cholesterol clogging up an artery, it took just a couple of years for the quagga mussels to infiltrate the 5km (3-mile) highway of pipes under the Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne (EPFL). By the time anyone realised what was going on, it was too late. The power of some heat exchangers had dropped by a third, blocked with ground-up shells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air conditioning faltered, and buildings that should have been less than 24C in the summer heat couldn’t get below 26 to 27C. The invasive mollusc had infiltrated pipes that suck cold water from a depth of 75 metres (250ft) in Lake Geneva to cool buildings. “It’s an open invasion,” says Mathurin Dupanier, utilities operations manager at EPFL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathurin Dupanier indicates the water cooling systems that were blocked by the invasive quagga mussels.

What we know on day 1,394&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian forces have struck a tanker in a southern Russian port and caused deaths,&lt;/strong&gt; the regional governor said early on Thursday. The strike in the southern Russian port of Rostov-on-Don damaged the vessel and, according to preliminary information, crew members had died, regional governor Yuri Slyusar said on Telegram. Mayor Alexander Skriabin was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying: “Emergency teams are extinguishing the fire on the tanker that was struck while docked in a drone attack … A leak of oil products was avoided. Unfortunately, there are dead and injured.” Slyusar also said parts of a high-rise apartment block under construction were damaged in the city and two private homes burned in a nearby town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian air strikes on and around the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/east-of-zaporizhzhia-ukraines-drone-crews-face-endless-battle-to-hold-the-line"&gt;Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/east-of-zaporizhzhia-ukraines-drone-crews-face-endless-battle-to-hold-the-line"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wounded at least 32&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt;, local authorities said. All the wounded came from the city and its surroundings, the head of the regional military administration, Ivan Fedorov, said on Telegram. Rescue services earlier said five children were among the casualties in a provisional toll of 30 after the Russian strikes on a block of flats, a house and an educational establishment on Wednesday. Firefighters were seen battling a blaze in a multi-storey housing block. Fedorov said two people were also wounded in a Russian drone strike on a civilian car in Kushuhum, south of Zaporizhzhia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be in Brussels on Thursday to convince European partners to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, despite Washington “pressuring” EU countries against the plan&lt;/strong&gt;, Agence France-Presse quoted an unnamed Ukrainian official as saying. The European Union has laid out a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/arguments-frozen-russian-assets-support-ukraine"&gt;plan to use the frozen assets&lt;/a&gt; to harness €90bn ($105bn) for a loan to help Ukraine repel Moscow’s forces, with the money to be paid back by any eventual Russian reparations to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belgian politicians and senior finance executives have been subject to a campaign of intimidation orchestrated by Russian intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; aimed at persuading the country to block the use of €185bn ($217bn) assets for Ukraine, according to European intelligence agencies. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/belgian-politicians-finance-bosses-targeted-russian-intelligence-seized-assets"&gt;Dan Sabbagh and Jennifer Rankin report&lt;/a&gt; that security officials indicated to the Guardian that there had been deliberate targeting of key figures at Euroclear, the securities depository holding the majority of Russia’s frozen assets, and leaders of the country. EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday are debating whether to approve the lending of urgently needed funds for Ukraine secured on Russian central bank assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was preparing to wage a new “year of war” on his country in 2026&lt;/strong&gt;, after Vladimir Putin said Moscow would “certainly” achieve its objectives. “Today, we heard yet another signal from Moscow that they are preparing to make next year a year of war,” the Ukrainian president said in his evening address on Wednesday. The statement was a reaction to the Russian president, who earlier said Moscow would “certainly” achieve its goals in its Ukraine offensive, including seizing Ukrainian territories it claims as its own, amid the flurry of international diplomacy to end the war. Putin warned that Moscow would seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its allies rejected the Kremlin’s demands in peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK has given its final warning to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/roman-abramovich"&gt;Roman Abramovich&lt;/a&gt; to release £2.5bn ($3.3bn) from the oligarch’s sale of Chelsea FC to give to Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, telling the billionaire to release the funds within 90 days or face court action, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/uk-will-transfer-abramovich-cash-from-sale-of-chelsea-to-ukraine-fund-starmer-says"&gt;reports Jessica Elgot&lt;/a&gt;.
