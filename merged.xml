According to the &lt;a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2025-course-be-joint-second-warmest-year-november-third-warmest-record"&gt;Copernicus Climate Change Service&lt;/a&gt;, 2025 will join 2023 and 2024 as the three warmest since the Industrial Revolution, reflecting the accelerating pace of the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mia Mottley is the prime minister of Barbados&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/16/ozone-layer-moment-methane-emissions-oil-gas-industry-climate-tipping-points"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a59c2a4d1f836aec83bf53a4cc7e84b2fa73a8c/689_0_5943_4754/master/5943.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=010c3867c839070d86de2a571e9aaef7" medium="image"/></item><item><title>UK unemployment rose to four-year high of 5.1% before budget</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/16/uk-unemployment-rise-high-budget-october-ons</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/16/uk-unemployment-rise-high-budget-october-ons</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 07:32:20 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;October figure from ONS suggests employers laid off workers, as earnings growth excluding bonuses fell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/dec/16/uk-jobs-market-unemployment-rises-wage-growth-slows-us-payrolls-economics-business-live-news-updates"&gt;Business live – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of UK unemployment rose to a four-year high of 5.1% in the three months to October, as the labour market showed signs of further weakening before last month’s budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wage growth excluding bonuses fell to 4.6% in October, from 4.7% the previous month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/16/uk-unemployment-rise-high-budget-october-ons"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6822a3bb08103f9758fd7963a7dfa6a184cf745b/834_468_3244_2597/master/3244.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=823f91c190f6db0d6ae4c4105bb57f4a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Starmer’s communications chief to address cabinet on media strategy overhaul</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/16/starmer-communications-chief-address-cabinet-media-strategy-overhaul</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/16/starmer-communications-chief-address-cabinet-media-strategy-overhaul</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 07:00:15 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Exclusive: David Dinsmore to advise ministers as they step up efforts to combat far-right rhetoric online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keir Starmer’s Whitehall communications chief will address the cabinet on overhauling the government’s media strategy on Tuesday as ministers increasingly try to combat far-right rhetoric online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Dinsmore, a former editor of the Sun who was appointed permanent secretary for government communications in November, will speak to ministers about modernising the way they reach voters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/16/starmer-communications-chief-address-cabinet-media-strategy-overhaul"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c54f606daea712e9180315ab00c14b75b2ecad7d/0_0_4801_3842/master/4801.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fe3c5c0d767eb1ac698012cade038367" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Tuesday briefing: What polar bear DNA tells us about a warming Arctic</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/monday-briefing-polar-bear-dna-arctic-climate-crisis-helena-horton</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/monday-briefing-polar-bear-dna-arctic-climate-crisis-helena-horton</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 06:50:14 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: As species across the world struggle to keep pace with global warming, ​how ​do we report the rare glimmers of hope without downplaying the accelerating ecological ​crisis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.

As the staccato sound of firecrackers and explosions rang out across Martyr’s Square in the heart of Tripoli, for once it was not Libya’s militias battling it out for a larger stake in the country’s oil economy, but a huge firework display celebrating the reopening of one of the finest museums in the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Museum of Libya – housing Africa’s greatest collection of classical antiquities in Tripoli’s historic Red Castle complex – had been closed for nearly 14 years due to the civil war that followed the former dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s downfall. Its ceremonial reopening came at the climax of a lavish show compressing Libya’s rich history and attended by diplomats and Arab celebrities, with a full-size Italian orchestra, acrobats, dancers, arches of fire and lights projected on to the fort. It did not lack for circus drama or cost, peaking with a billowing Ottoman sailing ship arriving high above the port on wires to be greeted by an angelic-appearing Libyan woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/libya-national-museum-reopens"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883d06d8628443e63d4613795e742cfa748901f9/527_713_3668_2935/master/3668.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=aafa63d7493c8c0aa4b8cb6d917b4852" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘We hate it.

Nothing had actually been constructed of this, supposedly the first phase of a high-speed line going north. The only trace was the furtive ecological consultants mapping newts and bats and the train’s looming presence in the minds of those who lived along the route. For many, it was a Westminster vanity project, symbolising a country run against the interests of the many to line the pockets of the few. People whose homes were under threat of demolition&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were petitioning parliament, campaigning for more tunnels or hoping the project would collapse before their farms, paddocks and ancient woodlands were wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line, we were told a decade ago, would be completed by 2026. Like many of the early claims about the longest railway to be built in Britain since the Victorian era, that fact no longer stands. The fast train is running – very – late. The official finish date of 2033 was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/18/hs2-delayed-beyond-2033-high-speed-rail"&gt;recently revised upwards&lt;/a&gt;. “The best guess is that it will begin with a ‘4’ when you can catch a train,” one well-informed observer told me. There’s similar uncertainty about its cost, but one thing is sure: it is catastrophically over budget. When complete, HS2 will almost certainly be the most expensive railway in the world. Nearly 20 years ago, HS1, the line from the Channel tunnel to St Pancras, was completed on time and on budget for £51m per mile (£87m in today’s prices). It was criticised for being twice as expensive as a high-speed route constructed in France. HS2 may cost almost £1bn per mile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/16/we-hate-it-its-desecration-the-real-cost-of-hs2"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d164b0a324b94e0660cbe35105d021db9b4e4bb/542_0_4476_3580/master/4476.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bf642ee323bb96194f88c0883367a255" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Locked down in a Bondi yoga studio amid the carnage outside I felt my world explode | Nadine J Cohen</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/16/bondi-shooting-locked-down-yoga-studio-survivor-story-ntwnfb</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/16/bondi-shooting-locked-down-yoga-studio-survivor-story-ntwnfb</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 04:26:42 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Our community is distraught, but Hanukah is a story of hope overcoming hatred &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most late Sunday afternoons, I do a double yoga class.

But last week, an influential progressive lobby group &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/kamala-harris-election-autopsy"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; its own. Kamala Harris’s campaign, its authors argued, failed to connect with core constituencies because it did not focus enough on addressing basic economic anxieties. By prioritising the menace to democracy that Maga authoritarianism represented, progressives neglected the bread-and-butter issues that were uppermost in many people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the EU braces for a tumultuous period of politics between now and the end of the decade, that is a lesson that needs to be fully absorbed in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. The White House, as its recently published national security strategy makes clear, is hopeful that “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe"&gt;patriotic” parties&lt;/a&gt; in Europe will soon replicate Mr Trump’s success. In the EU’s Franco-German engine room, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; the polls, backed by large swaths of blue-collar voters. But among mainstream leaders and parties, it is hard to discern a response that is adequate to troubling times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/the-guardian-view-on-combating-europes-national-populists-protect-the-less-well-off-from-the-winds-of-change"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87b071d219ec88cddcced368d720e6820d5ed72b/0_0_1941_1552/master/1941.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=4e057fb9345f9cdd31975f7d309d57de" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Chile’s new far-right head is latest Latin American leader to ride hardline wave to power</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/jose-antonio-kast-chile-election-analysis</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/jose-antonio-kast-chile-election-analysis</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 19:28:02 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;From the US to Hungary to Argentina, rightwing leaders are praising José Antonio Kast’s win in Chile’s presidential race&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;José Antonio Kast’s victory in Chile’s presidential election has been widely praised by leaders of the global right, with congratulations coming from the US secretary of state Marco Rubio, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, Argentina’s Javier Milei and X’s Elon Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a Nazi party member, a father of nine and a staunch Catholic known for opposing abortion and same-sex marriage, Kast won 58.16% of the vote in the runoff – more than 2m votes than the leftist Jeannette Jara, a former labour minister under the current president, Gabriel Boric.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/jose-antonio-kast-chile-election-analysis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69efe18e9242401e1a77d823f1bea8289b544269/916_0_4510_3609/master/4510.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=03473fa62a8c52642bfa140de59c5d00" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Any Russia-Ukraine deal is doomed without security guarantees, says Starmer</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/russia-ukraine-deal-security-guarantees-starmer</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/russia-ukraine-deal-security-guarantees-starmer</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:58:59 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Prime minister reiterates support for Kyiv as it comes under mounting US pressure to sign up to Trump-backed plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will fail unless it is backed up by “robust” security guarantees from western powers, the UK prime minister has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keir Starmer, speaking ahead of talks with European leaders in Berlin, told MPs on Monday he was opposed to any agreement that did not include sufficient military guarantees for Ukraine, as Kyiv comes under mounting US pressure to sign up to a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/11/us-wants-ukraine-to-withdraw-from-donbas-and-create-free-economic-zone-says-zelenskyy"&gt;Trump-backed plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/russia-ukraine-deal-security-guarantees-starmer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4aa93dc1241098d818ba0b0772fd574d657a1ad/145_0_1349_1079/master/1349.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e1195d85cb63ab2885c59accf2b23473" medium="image"/></item><item><title>International law on the killing of people who survive an attack at sea | Letter</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/dec/15/international-law-on-the-killing-of-people-who-survive-an-attack-at-sea</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/dec/15/international-law-on-the-killing-of-people-who-survive-an-attack-at-sea</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 18:02:27 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;William Schabas&lt;/strong&gt; on the conviction of two officers of a German submarine of ‘an offence against the law of nations’ during the first world war&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidney Blumenthal referred to a 1945 war crimes judgment on the killing of seamen who had survived an attack at sea during the second world war (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/08/does-pete-hegseth-even-believe-that-war-crimes-exist"&gt;Does Pete Hegseth even believe that war crimes exist?, 8 December&lt;/a&gt;). There is an even earlier case. In a trial held by a German court pursuant to the treaty of Versailles (1919), two officers of U-86 were convicted of “an offence against the law of nations” for attacking survivors after the sinking of a Canadian hospital ship, the Llandovery Castle, off the coast of Ireland in the final months of the first world war. The judges said the rule against such attacks was “simple” and “universally known”. They rejected the defence argument that the officers were following orders of the submarine’s captain. They said such an order was manifestly unlawful. The precedent is still cited today and is codified in the Rome statute of the international criminal court. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;William Schabas&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professor of international law, Middlesex University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/dec/15/international-law-on-the-killing-of-people-who-survive-an-attack-at-sea"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/888bc2223191356c1d6e90c4800b049bc30a0c01/739_0_4049_3239/master/4049.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b37472320ee0cd8afcea9aca5ae166d2" medium="image"/></item><item><title>We must not stop research on solar geoengineering | Letters</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/15/we-must-not-stop-research-on-solar-geoengineering</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/15/we-must-not-stop-research-on-solar-geoengineering</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 18:03:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryony Worthington &lt;/strong&gt;says the media should not be pushing a western attitude to climate strategies to the detriment of African nations.

The pretext for forming this opinion – and claiming it represents all of Africa – appears to be the brief reference in a joint statement earlier this year from the &lt;a href="https://www.solargeoeng.org/african-ministers-call-for-a-non-use-agreement-on-solar-geoengineering/"&gt;African environmental ministers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t help feeling that the Guardian is being played. Every advance in human technology elicits cries from a vocal few that a line must be drawn that cannot be crossed.

The recipes were not all that intelligent. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; had taken elements of similar recipes from multiple creators and Frankensteined them into something barely recognizable. In &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o"&gt;one memorable case&lt;/a&gt;, the Google AI failed to distinguish the satirical website the Onion from legitimate recipe sites and advised users to cook with non-toxic glue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, bloggers who have not secured their sites behind a paywall have seen their carefully developed and tested recipes show up, often without attribution and in a bastardized form, in ChatGPT replies. They have seen dumbed-down versions of their recipes in AI-assembled cookbooks available for digital downloads on Etsy or on AI-built websites that bear a superficial resemblance to an old-school human-written blog. Their photos and videos, meanwhile, are repurposed in Facebook posts and Pinterest pins that link back to this digital slop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/15/google-ai-recipes-food-bloggers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dad6c44cff97b68d6e8c95e43637b3b460a7a57/398_0_7162_5733/master/7162.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e612fec1c9b4661fc35b370bbd956cb1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Just disgraceful’: outcry as Heritage thinktank appoints far-right figure to key post</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/heritage-foundation-thinktank-scott-yenor</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/heritage-foundation-thinktank-scott-yenor</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:00:56 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Scott Yenor, who has offered views on women, marriage and LGBTQ rights, helped to found secretive fraternal order&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Heritage Foundation, an influential rightwing thinktank &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/20/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson"&gt;currently mired in controversy&lt;/a&gt;

Amid all the noise, it’s difficult to know how bad this flu really is – and how much is political spin. I should start by saying “super flu” is not a scientific term or one used by any academics or clinicians I work with. It’s a colloquial phrase that’s been used by various NHS England bosses and taken up by Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/resident-doctors-strike-super-flu-keir-starmer-nhs"&gt;Keir Starmer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, a couple of factors have come together to make it a harder flu season for hospitals to manage. First, flu has arrived earlier than previous years. This isn’t unique to the UK: it’s the same picture across the US, Canada, Japan, Germany – basically the northern hemisphere going into winter. This is in the context of multiple viruses circulating such as Covid and rhinoviruses, which means patients could be fighting one or more viruses at the same time and are more susceptible to getting sicker from influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyond&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Showcased as part of the Highland museum’s virtual Advent calendar on Instagram last week, it’s a late-18th-century Staffordshire pottery flask – to be filled with strong drink and used to toast a safe journey for a traveller – shaped like a very realistic, knobbly spud, complete with green bits. The benefactor who donated the flask apparently explained it was so ugly that no one in his family wanted to inherit it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 15,000 Instagram likers beg to differ, including me: I desperately covet this beauteous and useful tuber, surely the ideal emotional support accessory for the season’s more trying social engagements. As the museum’s representative explains, the potato was “seen as a very fashionable vegetable” back then, and I think we need to think hard about that: why isn’t it now? It might be the most valuable player on the Christmas dining table (don’t even think about arguing), but it’s cruelly taken for granted. Have we ever considered the potato as a gift, an aesthetic, a mood?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/a-potato-is-for-life-not-just-for-christmas"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/335e3cd5ead5a46251bcce2124160d5f44867610/941_362_4771_3817/master/4771.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=409334cc2bb2d77b4e3b0a1c35411ed6" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The US supreme court’s TikTok ruling is a scandal | Evelyn Douek and Jameel Jaffer</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/supreme-court-tiktok-ruling</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/supreme-court-tiktok-ruling</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 11:00:30 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The decision means TikTok now&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of Trump’s pen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judicial opinions allowing the government to suppress speech in the name of national security rarely stand the test of time. But time has been unusually unkind to the US supreme court decision that upheld the law banning &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, the short-form video platform. The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress passed the TikTok ban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia University&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/supreme-court-tiktok-ruling"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a1c7bda187b8142a4f5b6493bab111c7b25ddd6/260_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=92f421a57aab8239c7a438bb1df865c4" medium="image"/></item><item><title>I hate this TV series I’m binge-watching, yet I’m on track to complete all 177 episodes.

What this means, to my dismay, is that I spent five entire days, five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;hours and 15 minutes of this autumn watching this series. In my defence, when I embarked on this rewatch, I was going through quite a trying time in my life. But I would find it difficult to excuse the fact that I didn’t just watch &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;House to take the edge off things, but attempted every single episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a deranged&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;television programme. It’s a tall order to select only a top 10 of the most bonkers plotlines – but here’s a representative handful. House kidnaps the star of his favourite medical soap opera because he has diagnosed him with a brain tumour just by watching him on TV. House pays an actor to pretend to die so that he can freak out his staff by bringing her “back to life” in the morgue. House performs surgery on his own leg in his bathtub to excise the tumours he got from taking medicine only approved for use on rats. A member of House’s team spends a whole episode trying to convince a suicidal patient that he deserves to live and is not a bad person, before it is revealed that the patient is a serial killer who has eaten at least 13 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/tv-binge-watching-episodes-house"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ab9e8a2f454ac2ad7f60c58ba5b153749ebec2c/444_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d3f7d643ba7007e0428d7c7cf92b2fd7" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Nancy Pelosi calls female US president in her lifetime unlikely: ‘Marble ceiling’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/nancy-pelosi-female-president</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/nancy-pelosi-female-president</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:00:29 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Former House speaker, 85, expects woman to assume Oval Office this generation but concedes she may not live to see it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, the outgoing congresswoman and former House speaker, has conceded that she may not see a woman be elected US president in her lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Democrat said as much in a &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/14/nancy-pelosi-trump-impeachment-woman-president/87628948007/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawOrxDhleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETF3RWM1cVlkVXZCZlBueDBIc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHjI8_PGx_1HdIFtKmrMcgH2iGIvUmff0XZ9A79dXHB_67YHnqtRItPUmz-8W_aem_g0IG1-JjOGlfn3AEHg5nFQ"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; interview published on Sunday with her &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/nancy-pelosi-democrat-tributes-retirement"&gt;retirement&lt;/a&gt; looming after four decades in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; – and invoked a turn of phrase referring to a metaphorical barrier impeding advancement in a profession that often confronts women and racial minorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/nancy-pelosi-female-president"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac809c2c649abb38a17a9fc0f7f1432010e553e1/397_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=17ca85f45f84d913f23edc98fc76a5e5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘I consider him my first son’: how living with a baby monkey taught me I’m ready to be a dad</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/15/baby-monkey-jungle-guinea-monkeys-aoe</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/15/baby-monkey-jungle-guinea-monkeys-aoe</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:00:30 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;I went from selling flats in Paris to being alone in a cabin in Guinea looking after primates.

To further the appreciation of culture among all the people, to increase respect for the creative individual, to widen participation by all&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the processes and fulfillments of art – this is one of the fascinating challenges of these days.” Those are the words of John F Kennedy, after whom the US’s national performing arts centre is named. The impulse to build it came from Dwight D Eisenhower; it was given JFK’s name after his assassination; and it opened in 1971, to the music of Leonard Bernstein and the choreography of Alvin Ailey, in the presidency of Richard Nixon. The Kennedy Centre, in short, was designed to be bipartisan, a place of gathering for Democrats and Republicans alike, a proud showcase of the best of America’s dance, opera and music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 50 years it carefully trod that line, its board balanced by members of Congress from both sides of the political divide. But it turns out it can take just months to unravel half a century of high-minded purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/trump-takeover-kennedy-center-warning-uk-arts-institutions"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/118ba8da7611735e0152135a4555bbf9ef39c7fd/664_0_6635_5311/master/6635.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a7aa474b85680e5308585b9f242367c9" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Monday briefing: The latest on the deadly attack on Bondi beach’s Jewish community</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/first-edition-bondi-beach-attack</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/first-edition-bondi-beach-attack</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 06:51:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: On Sunday evening local time, two gunmen opened fire on a gathering at Sydney’s famous beach – here’s what we know so far&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.

And our political establishment is allowing it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as I was starting to write this column, an email alert popped up on my screen. “Punters back Nigel for prime minister after Keir Starmer,” it read, placing the Reform leader second in the odds market after Wes Streeting. What a weird, dissonant duality this is. Nigel Farage is in his fourth week of revelations about alleged racist behaviour at school, and yet, here we are. This is one of those twilight-zone moments in British politics, where it seems something is going to “cut through” any minute now. For a moment it seems as if it absolutely will. And then, there’s a loss of momentum and a return to the status quo. In my mind it manifests like a battle of physical forces, acting on one another. Journalistic investigations, testimonies, whistleblowers, all as a sort of storm that blows on a political actor who may be knocked off his feet, but still manages to cling on by his fingernails, until the gale blows over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up scrambles Farage, a few pieces and more than a few &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2025/dec/04/can-farage-survive-racism-allegations-the-latest"&gt;polling points&lt;/a&gt; knocked off him, but still in place. This is, so far, what he is managing to survive – the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/07/nigel-farage-should-apologise-after-racism-allegations-says-former-watchdog-head"&gt;testimonies&lt;/a&gt; of some 28 of Farage’s contemporaries at Dulwich college who have told the Guardian that they experienced or witnessed racist or antisemitic behaviour when he was a teenager. Jewish students were taunted; “gas them,” Farage said, “Hitler was right”. A black student, much younger than the then 17-year-old Farage, was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/05/nigel-farage-former-dulwich-college-pupil-alleges-said-thats-the-way-back-to-africa"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt;: “That’s the way back to Africa.” The allegations amount, in my reading, to a sort of obsessive campaign against minority students, pursued with the kind of bewildering commitment that anyone who has ever been bullied will feel in their bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/nigel-farage-accused-racism-lead-polls-reform-allegations"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48436fcbc46034e894c9480ae12e356f999e86b4/74_0_4076_3261/master/4076.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=22c503466a0ae0f9521b6e68bfc38602" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Young people bearing brunt of UK jobs downturn, thinktank warns</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/15/young-people-bearing-brunt-of-uk-jobs-downturn-thinktank-warns</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/15/young-people-bearing-brunt-of-uk-jobs-downturn-thinktank-warns</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 06:00:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Resolution Foundation report comes in week when data is expected to show October unemployment rise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are bearing the brunt of Britain’s jobs downturn, according to a report, before official figures this week that are expected to show the UK &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/unemployment"&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt; rate rising to 5.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Resolution Foundation thinktank said a “jobs deficit” was pushing a growing number of graduates and non-graduates into unemployment as employers reduced hiring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/15/young-people-bearing-brunt-of-uk-jobs-downturn-thinktank-warns"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b11f036735f33e3554d9860c0af21d79a43dbb43/459_1693_3433_2748/master/3433.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=94dbc30ccd6f26325a57260340a6a485" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘People were in tears on set’: the emotional return of word-of-mouth sensation Two Doors Down</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/15/two-doors-down-sitcom-christmas-special</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/15/two-doors-down-sitcom-christmas-special</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 06:00:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The outrageous Scottish sitcom became a sleeper hit – then its co-creator died tragically.

Not because the world needed permission to enjoy pizza – it clearly didn’t – but because the news soothed a longstanding national irritation: France and Japan, recognised in 2010 and 2013, had beaten us to it. For Italy’s culinary patriots, this had become a psychological pebble in the shoe: a tiny, persistent reminder that someone else had been validated first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the strength of Italian cuisine has never rested on an ancient, coherent culinary canon. Most of what passes for ancient “regional tradition” was assembled in the late 20th century, largely for tourism and domestic reassurance. The real history of Italian food is turbulent: a saga of hunger, improvisation, migration, industrialisation and sheer survival instinct. It is not a serene lineage of grandmothers, sunlit tables and recipes carved in marble. It is closer to a national long-distance sprint from starvation – not quite the imagery Italy chose to present to Unesco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberto Grandi is the author of La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste and a professor of food history at the University of Parma&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/myth-traditional-italian-cuisine-food"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db07b445fc0578563d0bcec7312dd6cd975ccaa/667_248_3572_2858/master/3572.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0924ebad0d7d7fac97517472752a5aa3" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Assad family live in Russian luxury as Bashar ‘brushes up on ophthalmology’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/assad-family-live-in-russian-luxury-as-bashar-brushes-up-on-ophthalmology</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/assad-family-live-in-russian-luxury-as-bashar-brushes-up-on-ophthalmology</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 05:00:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Family friend, sources in Russia and Syria, and leaked data help give rare insight into life of dictator’s reclusive household&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, a group of teenage boys spray-painted a warning on to a wall in their school playground: “It’s your turn, Doctor.” The graffiti was a thinly veiled threat that Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, a London-trained ophthalmologist, would be next in the line of Arab dictators toppled by the then raging Arab spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took 14 years, during which 620,000 were killed and nearly 14 million displaced, but eventually the doctor’s turn came and Assad was deposed, fleeing to Moscow in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/assad-family-live-in-russian-luxury-as-bashar-brushes-up-on-ophthalmology"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb60da7b759a6480a6b4698ca591177c19746f3c/191_0_1907_1526/master/1907.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0cdb2f5bfb499c6b9f6c15f37e9050a4" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The snail farm don: is this the most brazen tax avoidance scheme of all time? – podcast</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/dec/15/the-snail-farm-don-is-this-the-most-brazen-tax-avoidance-scheme-of-all-time-podcast</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/dec/15/the-snail-farm-don-is-this-the-most-brazen-tax-avoidance-scheme-of-all-time-podcast</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 05:00:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Terry Ball – renowned shoe salesman, friend to former mafiosi – has vowed to spend his remaining years finding ways to cheat authorities he feels have cheated him.

As I did so, I was immediately assailed by imagery of bodies lying on the ground, barely hidden from view. I closed these videos immediately, knowing the way this imagery can stick in one’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When terrible events such as yesterday’s attack occur, we often race to find out as much as possible about what happened. We do so by trawling social media and news sites. This is a natural way of making sense of events, and reflects a human urge to know what is occurring around us in order to keep us safe. Sometimes it’s a more prurient interest, like the way we slow down to look at a crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ahona Guha is a clinical and forensic psychologist, trauma expert and author from Melbourne.

European leaders to join day two of talks in Berlin. What we know on day 1,391&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The head of Britain’s foreign spy service, known as MI6, will warn that Russia poses an “aggressive, expansionist, and revisionist” threat&lt;/strong&gt;, in her first speech since taking office. Blaise Metreweli took over from Richard Moore in October, becoming the first female chief of MI6. “[Vladimir] Putin should be in no doubt, our support is enduring. The pressure we apply on Ukraine’s behalf will be sustained,” Metreweli will say on Monday, according to advance extracts of her remarks. “The export of chaos is a feature not a bug in the Russian approach to international engagement, and we should be ready for this to continue until Putin is forced to change his calculus,” she said, according to the extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, &lt;strong&gt;Richard Knighton, head of Britain’s armed forces&lt;/strong&gt;, will also call in a separate speech on Monday for a &lt;strong&gt;“whole society” approach&lt;/strong&gt; to defence in the face of growing uncertainty and threats, and highlight an increased probability of Russia invading a Nato country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian leader called on Sunday for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt; as he attended talks with US figures in Berlin – the latest efforts to end the war with Russia. “Ukraine needs peace on dignified terms, and we are ready to work as constructively as possible. The coming days will be filled with diplomacy. It is critically important that it delivers results,” Zelenskyy said on X. He later added ahead of a meeting with US officials: “The key thing is that all the steps we agree on with partners must work in practice to deliver guaranteed security. Only reliable guarantees can deliver peace.” Zelenskyy is expected to comment on the talks once they are completed on Monday, &lt;strong&gt;when they are expected to be joined by other European leaders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian leader said that a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia along the current frontlines would be a fair option&lt;/strong&gt; in any peace deal. Russia has demanded Kyiv withdraw its troops from parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that Ukraine still holds. Answering questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat, Zelenskyy reiterated that option would be unfair, adding that the issue of territory remained unresolved and very sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US special envoy Steve Witkoff said “a lot of progress was made” at the first day of talks.&lt;/strong&gt; The meeting between US and Ukrainian delegations included Witkoff, president Zelenskyy, Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and European officials. “Representatives held in-depth discussions ... a lot of progress was made, and they will meet again tomorrow morning,” Witkoff said in a post on X. The talks ended after more than five hours on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/14/ukraine-willing-to-drop-ambitions-to-join-nato-zelenskyy-says"&gt;offer to forgo joining the Nato&lt;/a&gt; military alliance probably will not significantly change the course of peace talks, two security experts said on Sunday.&lt;/strong&gt; “This doesn’t move the needle at all,” said Justin Logan, director of defence and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. “It’s an effort to appear reasonable.” Nato membership for Ukraine has not been realistic in a long time anyway, said Logan and Andrew Michta, a professor of strategic studies at the University of Florida. Michta called Ukraine’s Nato admittance a “non-issue” at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin said on Sunday that Nato secretary general Mark Rutte’s remarks about preparing for war with Russia were irresponsible&lt;/strong&gt; and showed that he did not really understand the devastation of the second world war. Rutte, in a speech in Berlin on Thursday, said that Nato should be “prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured” and asserted that “we are Russia’s next target”. “Kremlin spokespersonDmitry Peskov told state television reporter Pavel Zarubin: “They have no understanding, and unfortunately, Mr Rutte, making such irresponsible statements, simply does not understand what he is talking about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drone fragments caused a fire near the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia’s Krasnodar region without inflicting any injuries or damage&lt;/strong&gt;, an emergency centre said on Sunday. “A gas pipe caught fire outside the refinery near one of the checkpoints. The fire covered an area of 100sqm and has since been extinguished,” the centre said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine had said earlier that its military had hit the refinery and an oil depot in the Russian Volgograd region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that its forces had captured the village of Varvarivka in Ukraine’s eastern Zaporizhzhia region&lt;/strong&gt;. Reuters could not verify battlefield reports of the both sides of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/ukraine-war-briefing-britains-spy-chief-to-warn-of-russias-expansionist-threat-as-berlin-talks-enter-second-day"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1815a7ffd2fe76610736b5e197e5f42c52c7aafe/253_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e774b4a87452d565f2f28d5eb2238403" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Jimmy Lai verdict: Hong Kong court to decide on national security charges against pro-democracy figure – live</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/15/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-court-national-security-charges-live</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/15/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-court-national-security-charges-live</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 02:20:41 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Incarcerated activist and media owner has been on trial for more than two years on national security charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-judges-national-security-charges"&gt;Jimmy Lai verdict: Hong Kong judges set to rule on national security charges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three high court judges have entered the courtroom and taken their seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearing is due to begin and Lai has entered the court, news reports are saying, adding that he waved to his family.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-democrats-video-message-to-military-is-seditious-behavior-punishable-by-death"&gt;said it was seditious&lt;/a&gt; for Democratic members of Congress to inform members of the military that they can, and indeed, must, resist patently illegal orders, and the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze832dr2n0o"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/us/politics/senator-mark-kelly-investigation-navy.html"&gt;Pentagon are reportedly investigating the members’ speech&lt;/a&gt;. Those related developments – the murder of civilians and an attack on free speech – exemplify two of Trump’s principal tactics in his second term. The first involves the assertion of extraordinary emergency powers in the absence of any actual emergency. The second seeks to suppress dissent by punishing those who dare to raise their voices. Both moves have been replicated time and time again since January 2025. How courts and the public respond will determine the future of constitutional democracy in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more essential to a liberal democracy than the rule of law – that is, the notion that a democratic government is guided by laws, not discretionary whims; that the laws respect basic liberties for all; and that independent courts have the authority to hold political officials accountable when they violate those laws. These principles, forged in the United Kingdom, adopted and revised by the United States, are the bedrock of constitutional democracy. But they depend on courts being willing and able to check government abuse, and citizens exercising their rights to speak out in defense of the fundamental values when those values are under attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Cole is the Honorable George J Mitchell professor in law and public policy at Georgetown University and former national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.

While the 6ft 9in center once regularly played more than 80 games in a regular season, he’s hit new career lows, appearing just 40 times on court during the 2024-2025 season. Following the money, however, suggests Thompson is pivoting into a new career. He’s rebranded as a crypto investor, consultant and brand ambassador, bringing his relative cultural cache to the blockchain. Now the host of his own podcast, Courtside Crypto, he has made frequent appearances with other crypto celebrities, such as at the Nasdaq in September, when he &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOtZyFejk7O/?img_index=4"&gt;celebrated the IPO of an explicitly nationalist Bitcoin mining operation&lt;/a&gt; alongside Eric Trump; Thompson has also developed a crypto startup slated to launch in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, crypto is back in style in Washington and among a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-05/celebrities-are-returning-to-the-crypto-salesforce"&gt;growing set in Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, where Thompson lives adjacent to the Kardashian clan, some of whom have been crypto spokespeople. Donald Trump has reversed Joe Biden’s legal offensive against crypto, debuting his own token, $Trump, before his inauguration, and rolling back government actions against the industry, which heavily supported him during his bid for the presidency.

Sherman, an associate producer of CBS Evening News Plus at the time, suspected that he would be laid off. CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, had closed a merger with the Hollywood studio Skydance in August, and planned to slash &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/business/media/paramount-layoffs-skydance.html"&gt;more than 2,000 jobs&lt;/a&gt; as part of corporate restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherman, who is Black, and Reiter, who is white, had an amicable conversation, according to Sherman. Reiter told Sherman that he was being laid off because his show was being eliminated, Sherman said, and that Reiter was unable to assign the team to other positions.

Some of Berlin’s most renowned clubs have long insisted that the camera lenses on their clientele’s phones must be covered up using this simple method, to ensure that everyone is present in the moment and people can let go without fear of their image suddenly appearing on some online platform. As one DJ &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/music/stickers-on-phone-cameras-berlin.html"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “Do you really want to be in someone’s picture in your jockstrap?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venues in London, Manchester and New York now enforce the same rules. Last week brought news of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/06/manchester-club-sankeys-reopening-2026"&gt;the return of Sankeys&lt;/a&gt;, the famous Mancunian club that closed nearly a decade ago, and is reopening in a 500-capacity space in the heart of the city. The aim, it seems, is to fly in the face of the massed closures of such venues, and revive the idea that our metropolises should host the kind of nights that stretch into the following morning. But there is another basic principle at work: phones will reportedly either be stickered or forbidden. “People need to stop taking pictures and start dancing to the beat,” &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/superclub-sankeys-back-first-time-32942151"&gt;said one of the club’s original founders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said a shelter-in-place was in effect for the area and encouraged people living near the campus to stay inside and not to return home until it was lifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital&lt;/strong&gt;, where six were in critical but stable condition, according to Kelly Brennan, a spokesperson for the hospital. A ninth person was later found to have been injured, but was reportedly not in a critical situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University officials initially told students and staff that a suspect was in custody, before later saying that was not the case and that police were still searching for a suspect or suspects&lt;/strong&gt;. The mayor said a person preliminarily thought to be involved was detained but was later determined to have no involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Donald Trump told reporters that he had been briefed on the shooting&lt;/strong&gt; and “all we can do right now is pray for the victims.” Earlier he claimed a suspect was in custody before rowing back on that statement and confirming the shooter was still at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The shooting occurred in the Barus + Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department&lt;/strong&gt;.

A common thread runs through much of their guidance: Americans, especially those in positions of power, must find the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/china-government-authoritarian.html"&gt;courage&lt;/a&gt; to stand up for what is right, even when doing so carries personal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet few have addressed the harder questions: how does one become courageous?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research shows that the British colonial wealth extraction system still influences the region’s tourist industry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luxury tourism in the Caribbean sells a kind of timelessness. A paradise of sun, sea and sand. But to step off the cruise ship or away from the all-inclusive resort is to see a more complex picture: a history of colonialism and a future of climate devastation. New &lt;a href="https://visualising-extractive-capitalism.common-wealth.org/"&gt;research from the Common Wealth thinktank&lt;/a&gt; maps how, over the 400 years since the first English ships arrived in Barbados, empire engineered a system of wealth extraction that shapes the tourism economies of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hilary-beckles"&gt;Hilary Beckles&lt;/a&gt;, Barbadian historian and chair of the &lt;a href="https://caricomreparations.org/"&gt;Caricom Reparations Commission&lt;/a&gt;, describes Barbados as the birthplace of British slave society. Between 1640 and 1807, Britain transported about 387,000 enslaved west Africans to the island. Extraordinary violence, from whippings to amputations and executions, were a regular feature of their lives. On the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/25/beatings-brandings-suicides-life-on-plantations-owned-by-church-of-england-missionary-arm"&gt;Codrington Plantation&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-18th century, 43% of the enslaved died within three years of their arrival. Life expectancy at birth for an enslaved person on the island was &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/203517"&gt;29 years old&lt;/a&gt;. This was the incalculable human cost of the transatlantic slave economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/12/rebranded-plantations-how-empire-shaped-luxury-caribbean-tourism"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s much more to do, but we should be encouraged by the progress we have made&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris climate treaty, one of the landmark days in climate-action history. Attending the conference as a journalist, I watched and listened and wondered whether 194 countries could ever agree on anything at all, and the night before they did, people who I thought were more sophisticated than me assured me they couldn’t. Then they did. There are a lot of ways to tell the story of what it means and where we are now, but any version of it needs respect for the complexities, because there are a lot of latitudes between the poles of total victory and total defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been dreading the treaty anniversary as an occasion to note that we have not done nearly enough, but in July I thought we might be able celebrate it. Because, on 23 July, the international court of justice handed down an epochal ruling that gives that treaty enforceable consequences it never had before. It declares that all nations have a legal obligation to act in response to the climate crisis, and, as Greenpeace International &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/77262/international-court-justice-historic-advisory-opinion-climate-impacts/"&gt;put&lt;/a&gt; it, “obligates states to regulate businesses on the harm caused by their emissions regardless of where the harm takes place. Significantly, the court found that the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is fundamental for all other human rights, and that intergenerational equity should guide the interpretation of all climate obligations.” The Paris treaty was &lt;a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/node/205627"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly as groundwork for this decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/paris-climate-treaty-anniversary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dying is a process and in a person’s final hours and days, Nickie and her Threshold Choir are there to accompany people on their way and bring comfort. Through specially composed songs, akin to lullabies, the choir cultivates an environment of love and safety around those on their deathbed. For the volunteer choir members, it is also an opportunity to channel their own experiences of grief and together open up conversations about death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With thanks to onscreen contributor, Lindsey, who died since the making of this film&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full interview with Nickie Aven, available &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2025/dec/12/threshold-the-choir-who-sing-to-the-dying-documentary"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/ng-interactive/2025/dec/12/threshold-the-choir-who-sing-to-the-dying-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unhurried trippy bass lines and poet Iona Lee’s commanding, velvety voice conjure a glamorously unhurried sense of  hypnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From&lt;/strong&gt; Edinburgh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended if you like&lt;/strong&gt; Dry Cleaning, Massive Attack, Nick Cave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up next&lt;/strong&gt; Warm Days in December out now, new EP due early 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As fixtures of Edinburgh’s gig-turned-performance art scene, Acolyte’s eerie, earthy psychedelia is just as likely to be found on stage at the Traverse theatre as in a steamy-windowed Leith Walk boozer. Their looped bass lines and poet Iona Lee’s commanding, velvety voice conjure a sense of slow-burn hypnosis – and just like their music, Acolyte are glamorously unhurried. They’ve released only a handful of songs in the seven years since Lee and bassist Ruairidh Morrison first started experimenting with jazz, trip-hop and spoken word, but now the group (with Daniel Hill on percussion and Gloria Black on synth, also known for throwing fantastical, papier-mache-costumed club nights with her former band Maranta) are gathering pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/12/add-to-playlist-the-slow-burn-psychedelia-of-acolyte-and-the-weeks-best-new-tracks"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists in Kansas believe Kernza could cut emissions, restore degraded soils and reshape the future of agriculture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the concrete floor of a greenhouse in rural Kansas stands a neat grid of 100 plastic plant pots, each holding a straggly crown of strappy, grass-like leaves. These plants are perennials – they keep growing, year after year. That single characteristic separates them from soya beans, wheat, maize, rice and every other major grain crop, all of which are annuals: plants that live and die within a single growing season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These plants are the winners, the ones that get to pass their genes on [to future generations],” says Lee DeHaan of &lt;a href="https://landinstitute.org/"&gt;the Land Institute&lt;/a&gt;, an agricultural non-profit based in Salina, Kansas. If DeHaan’s breeding programme maintains its current progress, the descendant of these young perennial crop plants could one day usher in a wholesale revolution in agriculture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/soil-is-more-important-than-oil-inside-the-perennial-grain-revolution"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Taylor Swift: The End of an Era review – as she breaks down over the terror plot, it’s impossible not to feel her pain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The singer’s tears over the Islamic State terrorist plot against her show and Southport attack make this behind-the-scenes docuseries about her world-conquering tour more moving than anyone could have anticipated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swifties had long guessed that there would be a documentary going behind the scenes of Taylor Swift’s blockbuster Eras tour. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/13/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-concert-film-review-a-cacophonous-testament-to-mega-stardom"&gt;2023 Eras Tour concert movie&lt;/a&gt; didn’t show any of the inner workings of this three-and-a-half-hour behemoth, which ran for 149 dates from 2023-24. Fans put some bits together, such as how Swift arrived on stage being pushed inside a cleaning cart. Plus, given the two albums she wrote during and about the Eras tour – 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department and this year’s The Life of a Showgirl – it wouldn’t be Swiftian to overlook another lucrative IP extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What fans could never have imagined was that Disney was set to start filming as the Eras tour was due to hit Vienna on 8 August 2023 – the first of three shows in the Austrian capital that were cancelled owing to an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/14/syrian-boy-trial-alleged-plot-bomb-taylor-swift-concert-vienna"&gt;Islamic State terrorist plot&lt;/a&gt;. We learn this in episode one of the six-part docuseries The End of an Era, when Swift and her longtime friend Ed Sheeran are backstage at Wembley, hours before he guests at her first concert after the thwarted attack. “I didn’t even get to go,” Swift tells him of Vienna. “I was on the plane headed there. I just need to do this show and re-remember the joy of it because I’m a little bit just like …” She can’t find the words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/12/taylor-swift-the-end-of-an-era-review-disney"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘If we build it, they will come’: Skövde, the tiny town powering up Sweden’s video game boom</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/12/skovde-sweden-video-games-goat-simulator-valheim-v-rising</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It started with a goat. Now – via a degree for developers and an incubator for startups – the tiny city is churning out world-famous video game hits. What is the secret of its success?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 26 March 2014, a trailer for a video game appeared on YouTube. The first thing the viewer sees is a closeup of a goat lying on the ground, its tongue out, its eyes open. Behind it is a man on fire, running backwards in slow motion towards a house. Interspersed with these images is footage of the goat being repeatedly run over by a car. In the main shot, the goat, now appearing backwards as well, flies up into the first-floor window of a house, repairing the glass it smashed on its way down. It hurtles through another window and back to an exploding petrol station, where we assume its journey must have started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wordless, strangely moving video – a knowing parody of the trailer for a zombie survival game called Dead Island – was for a curious game called Goat Simulator. The game was, unsurprisingly, the first to ever put the&amp;nbsp;player into the hooves of a goat, who must enact as much wanton destruction as possible. It was also the first massive hit to come out of a small city in Sweden by the name of Skövde.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/12/skovde-sweden-video-games-goat-simulator-valheim-v-rising"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lawyers say people ‘don’t feel safe to leave their home’ as officials target recent arrivals and those awaiting hearings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigration agents appear to be increasingly arresting and detaining Afghan asylum seekers, especially men, who have arrived in the US recently and are awaiting court hearings to decide their cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir – an asylum seeker who came to the US via Mexico in 2024 – was driving home from his English class in Bloomington, Indiana just after noon on Monday, when he was pulled over by an unmarked police vehicle. Minutes later, the asylum seeker from Afghanistan was cuffed and driven to a detention center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/12/afghan-asylum-seekers-immigration"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Senior commanders accused of atrocities against civilians face asset freezes – but no action against key backer UAE  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has placed sanctions on four senior commanders of Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces suspected of involvement in “heinous” &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/05/rsf-massacres-sudanese-city-el-fasher-slaughterhouse-satellite-images"&gt;violence against civilians in the city of El Fasher&lt;/a&gt;, but decided not to take any action against their key military and diplomatic backer, the United Arab Emirates, or their chief commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British officials suggested they preferred to use their leverage with the UAE and the RSF commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, privately, but admitted there was little sign of a ceasefire in Sudan’s near three-year civil war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/uk-sanctions-four-rsf-commanders-heinous-violence-against-sudan-civilians"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With ICE targeting vendors and fear rising, community groups are organising fast to keep New Yorkers working on the streets safe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a December day when temperatures dipped below 20 degrees, Street Vendor Project staff walked along a busy commercial street in the Bronx, handing out “know your rights” information to vendors selling fruits and vegetables. Several vendors mentioned they were scared after watching videos of immigration raids across the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used to go around helping vendors apply for permits so they wouldn’t get fined,” said Eric Nava-Pérez, Street Vendor Project’s Spanish-speaking member organizer. “But now, we’re out here distributing immigration rights information.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/12/new-york-street-vendors-ice-national-guard"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Comforting reassurance was once the work of the church. Now it’s increasingly being sought from the machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few summers ago I attended two funerals in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One was for a man who was atheist and had lots of worldly success. The second was for a woman who was Catholic, raised three children and lived a much quieter life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a special way of being afraid&lt;br /&gt;
 No trick dispels. Religion used to try,&lt;br /&gt;
 That vast moth-eaten musical brocade&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Welcome to the 2026 World Cup shakedown! The price of a ticket: the integrity of the game | Marina Hyde</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In World Cup parlance, Qatar was Fifa president Gianni Infantino’s qualifier. Now it’s the big time for Trump’s dictator-curious protege&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to think Fifa’s recent practice of holding the World Cup in autocracies was because it made it easier for world football’s governing body to do the things it loved: spend untold billions of other people’s money and siphon the profits&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;without having to worry about boring little things like human rights or public opinion. Which, let’s face it, really piss around with your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for a while now, that view has seemed ridiculously naive, a bit like assuming Recep Erdoğan followed Vladimir Putin’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/26/turkey-people-protest-street-authoritarian-leader"&gt;election-hollowing gameplan&lt;/a&gt; just because hey, he’s an interested guy who likes to read around a lot of subjects. So no: Fifa president Gianni Infantino hasn’t spent recent tournaments cosying up to authoritarians because it made his life easier. He’s done it to learn from the best. And his latest decree this week simply confirms Fifa is now a fully operational autocracy in the classic populace-rinsing style. Do just absorb yesterday’s news that the &lt;em&gt;cheapest&lt;/em&gt; ticket for next year’s World Cup final in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/11/world-cup-2026-ticket-prices-fifa"&gt;will cost £3,120&lt;/a&gt; – seven times more than the cheapest ticket for the last World Cup final in Qatar. (Admittedly, still marginally cheaper than an off-peak single from London to Manchester.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/2026-world-cup-fifa-trump-gianni-infantino-donald-trump"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Martin Compston and Meera Syal are among the names in this tale of divorcees hitting back at their exes. It’s a thriller, comedy and psychodrama all at once – but could maybe do with being more simple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes three-in-one type things are good. Phone chargers with lots of leads for all your devices that have stupidly different ports. Those woolly hats that cover your neck and lower face, so you look daft but are impregnable to winter cold. The Nars blusher stick that is also a lipstick and eyeshadow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to dramas, however, it’s best to stick to one field of endeavour. The Revenge Club is a gallimaufry of tones, styles and performances. Watching it is like looking through a kaleidoscope that someone twists for you every few minutes; it’s fun but quite disorienting after a while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/12/the-revenge-club-review-this-starry-divorce-caper-makes-you-want-to-laugh-and-cry-at-the-same-time"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An array of under-the-radar initiatives are taking hold across the US, often tied to immunization, fluoridation and raw milk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even within the freak show that is Donald Trump’s cabinet, the health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has a singular knack for dominating the headlines with the most disturbing sort of carnivalesque spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, he’s amplified harmful misinformation linking &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/reupping-unproven-claims-about-tylenol-kennedy-claims-a-link-between-circumcision-and-autism"&gt;Tylenol and autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-06-13/kennedy-new-cdc-panel-vaccine-misinformation"&gt;dismissed&lt;/a&gt; the entire CDC vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with skeptics and conspiracy theorists. And even as that agency &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/health/cdc-vaccine-committee-newborns-hepatitis-b.html"&gt;debated&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/cdc-panel-rfk-hepatitis-b-vaccine"&gt;scrapped &lt;/a&gt;its hepatitis B vaccination recommendation for many newborns, Kennedy courted further controversy for his &lt;a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/12/03/2025/kennedy-likely-to-stay-silent-as-nuzzi-lizza-feud-rages-on"&gt;alleged involvement&lt;/a&gt; in a tabloid-fodder love triangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor and publisher of the Nation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a contributor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/rfk-jr-public-health-danger-maha-local-laws"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the classic album hits 50, Nick Mason talks about the often difficult process of making it and how it has since fit into their larger catalogue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By almost every measure, from commercial reward to creative reach, Pink Floyd scaled its peak on Dark Side of the Moon. But, when I asked drummer Nick Mason how he would rank the album in their catalogue, he slotted it below the set that came next, Wish You Were Here. Speaking of Dark Side, he said, “the idea of it is almost more attractive than the individual songs on it. I feel slightly the same about Sgt. Pepper. It’s an amazing album that taught us a hell of a lot, but the individual parts are not quite as exciting, or as good, as some of the other Beatles’ albums.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, he says of Wish You Were Here, “there’s something in the general atmosphere it generates – the space of it, the air around it, that’s really special,” he said. “It’s one of the reasons I view it so affectionately.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/12/50-years-pink-floyd-wish-you-were-here-album"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Donald Trump is pursuing regime change – in Europe | Jonathan Freedland</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US made it clear this week that it plans to help the parties of the European far right gain power. Keir Starmer and his fellow leaders have to face this new reality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When are we going to get the message? I joked a few months back that, when it comes to Donald Trump, Europe needs to learn from Sex and the City’s Miranda Hobbes and realise that “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/28/donald-trump-orange-hurricane-keir-starmer-warn-britain-danger"&gt;He’s just not that into you&lt;/a&gt;”. After this past week, it’s clear that understates the problem. Trump’s America is not merely indifferent to Europe – it’s positively hostile to it. That has enormous implications for the continent and for Britain, which too many of our leaders still refuse to face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depth of US hostility was revealed most explicitly in the new &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf"&gt;US national security strategy&lt;/a&gt;, or NSS, a 29-page document that serves as a formal statement of the foreign policy of the second Trump administration. There is much there to lament, starting with the sceptical quote marks that appear around the sole reference to “climate change”, but the most striking passages are those that take aim at Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Europe must realise its superior economic and military potential has to be mobilised, writes &lt;strong&gt;Bill Jones, &lt;/strong&gt;while &lt;strong&gt;Robin Wilson &lt;/strong&gt;addresses Belgium’s resistance to seizing Russian assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wholly support the plea to Europe by Timothy Garton Ash (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/06/europe-ukraine-putin-trump-eu"&gt;Only Europe can save Ukraine from Putin and Trump – but will it?, 6 December&lt;/a&gt;). One aspect he did not mention was the strategic nuclear balance. Since the late 1940s, responsibility for deterrence has always lain with the Pentagon and has succeeded in keeping the peace, though at times a very fragile version of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent US statement on defence makes it clear that Europe is no longer seen as a priority by the Trump administration, the danger now being that doubt is crucially being raised as to the credibility of Nato’s deterrent. Without certainty of a reaction in kind, Russia, under its ambitious and risk-taking president, might be tempted to chance its arm in what almost looks like a ceding of Europe by the US into a Russian “sphere of influence”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/the-importance-of-europe-in-curbing-russias-might"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guardian readers share their views on a proposed shorter working week for educators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teacher who already works four days (albeit I don’t get paid for the fifth), I can wholeheartedly say it has transformed my relationship with the job (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/09/four-day-week-schools-parents-teachers-england-wales"&gt;‘Bring it on!’: growing support in England for four-day week in schools, 9 December&lt;/a&gt;). I no longer have the dread of weekends and holidays with insurmountable mountains of work. The move to a four-day teaching week would need to be thought about carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, for one, would not want to have one full day out of school – this would mean four straight days of teaching. In most schools, a day not teaching would equate to five planning, preparation and assessment periods (PPAs).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/12/will-a-four-day-week-for-teachers-work"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

But let’s be clear about the strikes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/12/christmas-strikes-resident-doctors-jenga-piece-collapses-nhs-wes-streeting"&gt;planned by resident doctors&lt;/a&gt; next week. They should not happen. They are reckless. They place the NHS and patients who need it in grave danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remain hopeful they can be averted. A good deal is on the table, and the British Medical Association (BMA) is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/10/resident-doctors-in-england-to-consult-on-calling-off-strikes"&gt;putting it to members&lt;/a&gt; this weekend.

      <title>Hunger’s whip: why connecting US food stamps to work is outdated and ineffective</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/snap-food-stamp-work-requirement</link>
      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/snap-food-stamp-work-requirement</guid>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In many parts of the country, there are new work requirements to get food aid. But starving people doesn’t motivate them – despite centuries of this rhetoric&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 200 years, common wisdom and policymakers have assumed that to get people to work, you had to make them hungry. New work requirements for Snap food benefits, which went into effect in most of the US on 1 December, are only the latest in a long line of policies based on this idea. The new rules cut off benefits for any non-disabled adult up to age 65 who cannot prove that they are working or seeking work at least 80 hours every month (that includes homeless people, veterans and former foster youth). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that &lt;a href="https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/"&gt;2.7 million people will lose their benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard this reasoning before: people are motivated to work because they and their families have to survive. If you give someone welfare – especially food aid – they become dependent and lazy. The Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative thinktank that has been campaigning for years to cut welfare, calls this “&lt;a href="https://thefga.org/research/universal-work-requirements/"&gt;the dependency trap&lt;/a&gt;”. Starving people by taking away their food stamps is supposed to “incentivize individuals to better themselves and transition from dependency to work and self-reliance”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/snap-food-stamp-work-requirement"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Readers respond to a report highlighting harsh disciplinary regimes at a school in east London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s little wonder that parents at Mossbourne Victoria Park academy (MVPA) are calling on the leadership of the school “to change course or be replaced” (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/09/london-academy-staff-instilled-climate-of-fear-among-pupils"&gt;London academy staff instilled ‘climate of fear’ among pupils&lt;/a&gt;, 9 December). It was a year ago that the Guardian’s John&amp;nbsp;Harris outlined the details of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/15/traumatise-children-education-london-academies-schools"&gt;an investigation&lt;/a&gt; carried out by the Observer into two Mossbourne academy schools, including MVPA. It had found, as Sir Alan&amp;nbsp;Wood has, that for many years horrendous tactics have been used to enforce discipline. Many staff were appalled and left, with the final straw for many being a teachers’ training session entitled “healthy fear”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/15/traumatise-children-education-london-academies-schools"&gt;Harris concluded &lt;/a&gt;then that there were “big questions about how academies and so-called free schools are scrutinised and overseen”, and it is certainly difficult to explain how Ofsted inspectors, regardless of the schools’ good examination results, could fail to notice both the appalling ways discipline was being enforced and the shocking after‑effects. Both schools were awarded the “outstanding” grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bernie Evans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liverpool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/12/fear-should-have-no-place-in-a-classroom-or-staffroom"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The UK art world is finally becoming more inclusive. But greater support must be given to the organisations that enable disabled artists to flourish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Turner prize is no stranger to sparking debate or pushing boundaries. This year it has achieved both. For the first time, an artist with learning disabilities has&amp;nbsp;won. Glasgow-born &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/10/nnena-kalu-turner-prize-win-interview-disabled-art"&gt;Nnena Kalu&lt;/a&gt; took the award for her colourful, cocoon-like sculptures made from VHS tape, clingfilm and other abandoned materials, along with her large swirling vortex drawings. Kalu is autistic,&amp;nbsp;with limited verbal communication. In an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cjwyn5llzn5t"&gt;acceptance speech&lt;/a&gt; on her behalf, Kalu’s facilitator, Charlotte Hollinshead, said that “a very stubborn glass&amp;nbsp;ceiling” had been broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalu’s win is a high-profile symbol of a shift towards greater inclusivity that has been happening in the UK arts world over the past five years.

      <title>The Guardian view on Trump and Venezuela: a return to seeking regime change | Editorial</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US is ramping up the pressure on Nicolás Maduro with a tanker seizure and expanded sanctions following threats and boat strikes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in his first term, Donald Trump mooted &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/11/donald-trump-venezuela-crisis-military-intervention"&gt;a “military option”&lt;/a&gt; for Venezuela to dislodge its president, Nicolás Maduro. Reports suggest that he &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/04/trump-suggested-invading-venezuela-report"&gt;eagerly discussed&lt;/a&gt; the prospect of an invasion behind closed doors. Advisers eventually talked him down. Instead, the US pursued a “maximum pressure” strategy of sanctions and threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mr Maduro is still in place. And Mr Trump’s attempts to remove him are ramping up again. The US has amassed its largest military presence in the Caribbean since &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/venezuela-panama-invasion-trump"&gt;the 1989 invasion of Panama&lt;/a&gt;. It has carried out more than 20 shocking &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/07/the-guardian-view-on-the-war-on-drugs-donald-trump-is-turning-a-failed-metaphor-into-a-more-dangerous-reality"&gt;strikes on alleged drug boats&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Trump reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/01/trump-maduro-ultimatum-relinquish-power-venezuela"&gt;delivered an ultimatum&lt;/a&gt; late last month, telling the Venezuelan leader that he could have safe passage from his country if he left immediately. There was already a $50m bounty on his head. This week came expanded sanctions and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/lawmakers-venezuela-oil-tanker"&gt;seizure of a tanker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Repeated fall storms led to the temporary lake, known as Lake Manly, appearing in basin 282ft beneath sea level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After record-breaking rains, an ancient lake in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2024/jul/12/heatwave-tourism-death-valley-in-pictures"&gt;Death Valley national park&lt;/a&gt; that had vanished has returned to view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temporary lake, known informally as Lake Manly, has appeared once more at the bottom of Badwater Basin, which sits 282ft beneath sea level, in California.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The seizure of the Skipper on Wednesday marked the first US capture of Venezuelan oil cargo since sanctions were imposed in 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan oil exports have reportedly fallen sharply since the US seized a tanker this week and imposed fresh sanctions on shipping companies and vessels doing business with Caracas, according to shipping data, documents and maritime sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast"&gt;seizure of the Skipper tanker off Venezuela’s coast&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday was the first US capture of Venezuelan oil cargo since sanctions were imposed in 2019 and marked a sharp escalation in rising tensions between the Trump administration and the government of Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/13/venezuela-oil-exports-reportedly-fall-sharply-after-us-seizure-of-tanker-skipper"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The former X Factor judge is back, auditioning boyband wannabes for his latest talent show – but gen Z doesn’t seem to care very much, or even know who he is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have we gone back in time to 2010? If only! No, Simon Cowell is just back in the headlines, reasserting his svengali status for his new Netflix show. Reviews suggest that Cowell’s attempted comeback, 15 years since his celebrity peak, highlights less his particular star power than how totally &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/simon-cowell-tv-search-boyband"&gt;the world has moved on&lt;/a&gt;. But is there anything to learn from SyCo now, and will his new boyband work? Let’s see!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Cowell is chasing a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;direction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/13/has-simon-cowell-lost-his-mojo-seven-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-music-moguls-new-direction"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The writer’s former partner and her co-star Ruby Ashbourne Serkis describe the bittersweet nature of remounting his 90s play so soon after his death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/dec/01/tom-stoppard-actors-playwright-rufus-sewell-christine-baranski-susan-wokoma-toby-jones-harriet-walter"&gt;‘We were swimming in the mind pool of Tom Stoppard!’ – actors salute the great playwright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t, I promise, refer to Felicity Kendal as Tom Stoppard’s muse. “No,” she says firmly. “Not this week.” Speaking to Stoppard’s former partner and longtime leading lady is delicate in the immediate aftermath of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/nov/29/tom-stoppard-playwright-of-dazzling-wit-and-playful-erudition-dies-aged-88"&gt;the writer’s death&lt;/a&gt;. But she is previewing a revival of his Indian Ink, so he shimmers through the conversation. The way Kendal refers to Stoppard in the present tense tells its own poignant story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settling into a squishy brown sofa at Hampstead theatre, Kendal describes revisiting the 1995 work, developed from a 1991 radio play. “It’s a play that I always thought I’d like to go back to.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Previously starring as Flora Crewe, a provocative British poet visiting 1930s India, she now plays Eleanor Swan, Flora’s sister. We meet Eleanor in the 1980s, fending off an intrusive biographer but uncovering her sister’s rapt and nuanced relationships in India.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/dec/13/felicity-kendal-tom-stoppard-indian-ink-ruby-ashbourne-serkis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As 27 European countries urge changes to laws forged after second world war, human rights chief says politicians are playing into hands of populists&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle had been brewing for months. But this week it came to a head in a flurry of meetings, calls and one heady statement. Twenty-seven European countries urged a rethink of the human rights laws forged after the second world war, describing them as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an impediment when it came to addressing migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International has called it “a moral retreat”. Europe’s most senior human rights official &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/dec/10/keir-starmer-hierarchy-of-people-constraining-human-rights"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the approach risked creating a “hierarchy of people” where some are seen as more deserving of protection than others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/dec/13/europe-echr-rethink-moral-retreat-say-human-rights-experts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I ate 3,000 meals for my ‘best of London restaurants’ list – and I hope you disagree with it | Jonathan Nunn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From pie-and-mash to the swank of a Michelin star, everyone has their own idea of what’s ‘best’. What’s yours?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Nunn is the author of London Feeds Itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 24 years ago, a small British food magazine called Restaurant &lt;a href="https://elbullifoundation.com/press/articulo/the-worlds-50-best-restaurants/"&gt;assembled an all-star panel&lt;/a&gt; – made up of Gordon Ramsay, John Torode, Aldo Zilli and 65 other food guys – to adjudicate on the world’s most stupid question: what is the best restaurant on the planet? It didn’t matter that no judge had been to all the restaurants on the shortlist, or that two of the judges happened to be Jeremy Clarkson and Roger Moore – what the editors of Restaurant understood is that people &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; a list, and if you order a group of restaurants from 50-1 and throw a party, people might take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could run and run,” the editors wrote in their intro, half hoping. They were right. Within two decades, The World’s 50 Best Restaurants had gone from what critic Jay Rayner described as a “&lt;a href="https://forums.egullet.org/topic/41262-restaurant-top-50-2004/page/5/"&gt;terribly successful marketing exercise&lt;/a&gt;” to an insurgent alternative to the ossified Michelin Guide, solidifying the reputations of El Bulli, the Fat Duck and then Noma as the “world’s best restaurant”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Nunn is a food and city writer based in London who co-edits the magazine Vittles.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hobnobs, ricotta, chocolate and amaretto – what’s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe in divine communion, especially when it comes to food; an alliance of ingredients that come together as though they were meant to feed spirit and body. It might be too lofty to say that this semifreddo is divine, but the combination of Hobnobs, ricotta, chocolate and amaretto really does it for me. That said, there are many alliances that can be formed in the Christmas store-cupboard, so use this as a base for any biscuits, dried fruit and chocolate to which you feel most spiritually aligned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/13/christmas-ricotta-semifreddo-recipe-meera-sodha"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goofy star of Mary Poppins becomes a centenarian on Saturday. And what a precocious performer he has proved, sustaining scrappy mischief through seven decades of mainstream entertainment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Hollywood stars grow old and die except perhaps one - Dick Van Dyke - who turns 100 today. The real world Peter Pan who used to trip over the ottoman on The Dick Van Dyke Show is still standing. The man who impersonated a wind-up toy in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang hasn’t wound down just yet. He has outlived mentors, co-stars, romantic partners and several studios. He’s even outlived the jokes about his performance in Mary Poppins. These days his &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/20/do-you-expect-me-to-talk-dick-van-dyke-says-he-turned-down-playing-james-bond"&gt;mangled cockney accent&lt;/a&gt; is regarded with more fondness than contempt. It’s seen as one of the great charms of the 1964 classic, along with the carousel chase or the cartoon dancing penguins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charm is the magic ingredient of every popular entertainer and few have possessed it in such abundance as Van Dyke, the impoverished son of a travelling cookie salesman who dropped out of high school and educated himself at the movies. “His job in this life is to make a happier world,” his Broadway co-star Chita Rivera once said - and this may explain his stubborn refusal to quit, not while times are tough and he feels that audiences still need cheering up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/13/dick-van-dyke-centenarian-100-mary-poppins-chitty-chitty-bang-bang"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Palestinians who have worked the ‘breadbasket’ area for generations face being replaced by Israeli settlers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death knell for the Palestinian village of Atouf, on the western slopes of the Jordan valley, arrived in the form of a trail of paper, a series of eviction notices taped to homes, greenhouses and wells, marking a straight line across the open fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notices, which appeared overnight, informed the local farmers that their land would be confiscated and that they had seven days from the date of their delivery, 4 December, to vacate their properties. A military road and accompanying barrier was to be built by Israel right through the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/13/new-israeli-barrier-slice-through-precious-west-bank-farmland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Edward Enninful: ‘Britain feels less tolerant now than we were in the 90s’</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The former British Vogue editor reflects on his early years in London, the importance of celebrating diversity and why he takes comfort in the younger generation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Edward Enninful was scouted on the tube travelling through London in 1988, it changed his life. The Ghanaian teenager, newly arrived in Britain, was drawn into the capital’s creative scene of the 90s – as a model, then stylist and, by 18, the fashion director of i-D magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was the height of the YBA [Young British Artists] movement – Jay Jopling, Tracey Emin. I met Kate [Moss] at a casting,” he recalls. “Then Naomi [Campbell] for a cover, and I knew we’d be great friends. We all hung out across disciplines. Friday rolled into Saturday into Sunday. I miss that rawness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/13/edward-enninful-interview-former-british-vogue-editor"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Colm Tóibín,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Robert Macfarlane, Elif Shafak, Michael Rosen and more share the novels, poetry and memoirs that make the perfect gift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love giving books as presents. I rarely give anything else. I strongly approve of the Icelandic tradition of the &lt;em&gt;Jólabókaflóðið&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Yule book flood), whereby books are given (and, crucially, read) on Christmas Eve. Nan&amp;nbsp;Shepherd’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/the-living-mountain-9780857861832/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article"&gt;The Living Mountain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the one I’ve given more often than any other; so much so that I keep a stack of four or five to hand, ready to give at Christmas or any other time of the year. It’s a slender masterpiece – a meditation on Shepherd’s lifelong relationship with the Cairngorm mountains, which was written in the 1940s but not published until 1977. It’s “about the Cairngorms” in the sense that Mrs Dalloway is “about London”; which is to say, it is both intensely engaged with its specific setting, and gyring outwards to vaster questions of knowledge, existence and – a word Shepherd uses sparingly but tellingly – love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/13/this-extraordinary-story-never-goes-out-of-fashion-30-authors-on-the-books-they-give-to-everyone"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three sweet treats for even the fussiest sweet tooth: fig and hazelnut crumble mince pies, sherry and raisin ice-cream, and chestnut and pear meringues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of sheer laziness, this is a no-churn, very quick to assemble take on things. I tend usually not to recommend no-churn ice-creams unless there is booze involved, so this sherry and raisin one is a great candidate (the alcohol stops the ice-cream from becoming too hard and crystallised). And keep the leftover egg whites from the mince pies to make the chestnut and pear meringue, an alternative for the Christmas pudding haters at your table – there is always one. I think it’s important to have at least two puddings at Christmas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/13/christmas-desserts-recipes--figgy-crumble-mince-pies-boozy-ice-cream-choc-pear-meringues-flora-shedden"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Australia’s social media ban has given us a way to fight big tech – and get my son back on his skateboard | Sisonke Msimang</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ban on under-16s accessing ‘harmful’ content that began this week has overwhelming approval from adults – even if it had a few teething issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, my 14-year-old went into the garage, pulled out his skateboard and told me this was going to be his “skate park summer”. I was curious about what was sparking his renewed interest in an activity he hadn’t thought about since he was 12. His response: “The ban.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled. As far as I was concerned, Australia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/10/how-the-world-media-covered-australias-under-16s-social-media-ban"&gt;world-first social media law &lt;/a&gt;aimed at preventing children under 16 from accessing social media apps was already a success. But this week, as the ban took effect, my son wasn’t so sure. Access to his accounts remained largely unchanged. Many of his friends were in the same position. Across the country, the rollout has been uneven, as social media companies try to work out how to verify kids’ ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisonke Msimang is the author of Always Another Country: A Memoir of Exile and Home (2017) and The Resurrection of Winnie Mandela (2018)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/13/australia-social-media-ban-fight-big-tech"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The actor, writer and comedian on turning his life around, fancying Cilla Black and his secret nose-picking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Coventry, Guz Khan, 39, was working as a secondary school teacher when he&amp;nbsp;began uploading comedy videos as&amp;nbsp;the character Mobeen in 2014. The following year, he gave up teaching to&amp;nbsp;pursue standup. In 2017, his show Man Like Mobeen was released by the&amp;nbsp;BBC and ran for five series. He won a Royal Television Society award in 2020 and was Bafta-nominated twice. His films include Army of Thieves and The Bubble. Guz Khan’s Custom Cars starts on Quest on 19 January. He is married with five children and lives in the West Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the trait you most deplore in&amp;nbsp;yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Impulsivity. We end up in strange places, like right now – I am in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/13/guz-khan-actor-comedian-writer-interview"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By using music from SZA, Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo in ICE videos, the government is playing a game of rage-bait&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; was engulfed in controversy over its illegal military strikes near Venezuela (among numerous other crises), a Department of Homeland Security employee – I picture the worst sniveling, self-satisfied, hateful loser – got to work on the official X account. The state-employed memelord posted a video depicting Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials arresting people in what appeared to be Chicago, celebrating the humiliation and incarceration of undocumented immigrants as some sort of patriotic achievement. The vile video borrowed, as they often do, from mainstream pop culture; in this case, a viral lyric from Sabrina Carpenter’s song Juno – “Have you ever tried this one?”, referring to sex positions – overlaid on clips of agents chasing, tackling and handcuffing people, cheekily nodding to all the methods in ICE’s terror toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter, as a pre-eminent pop star, was caught in an impossible position. Say nothing, as her friend and collaborator Taylor Swift did weeks earlier when the White House used her music in a Trump hype video, and risk &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/15/taylor-swift-silence-trump-administration-speaks-volumes"&gt;appearing as if you condone&lt;/a&gt; the administration’s use of your art for a domestic terror campaign (the administration hasn’t yet used Swift for an ICE video, but I’m sure it’s coming); or engage, even if to honestly express your utter disgust, and risk bringing more attention to objectionable propaganda designed to provoke a response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/dec/13/trump-ice-video-music"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most exciting places our writers came across this year, from untouched islands in Finland to an affordable ski resort in Bulgaria and the perfect Parisian bistro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a midsummer trip to Ireland, I saw dolphins in the Irish Sea, sunset by the Liffey, and misty views of the Galtee Mountains. The half-hour &lt;a href="https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/station/cobh"&gt;train journey to Cobh&lt;/a&gt; (“cove”), through Cork’s island-studded harbour, was especially lovely. As the railway crossed Lough Mahon, home to thousands of seabirds, there was water on both sides of the train. I watched oystercatchers, egrets, godwits and common terns, which nest on floating pontoons. Curlews foraged in the mudflats, and an old Martello tower stood on a wooded promontory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/dec/13/travel-writers-top-25-favourite-travel-discoveries-europe-2025"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

But high among these culinary heavyweights sits a humble &lt;em&gt;salonu&lt;/em&gt; tucked away in the depths of north London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neco Tantuni, a small Turkish eatery specialising in the foodie delights of Mersin, a city located on the southern coast of Turkey, has been crowned the fourth best restaurant in London by Vittles, the trendy food magazine that has become a bible for those looking for the best (and more off-the-radar) grub in the capital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/13/neco-tantuni-turkish-restaurant-enfield-london-food-vittles-list"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This spectacular image taken in Sakrisøy, Norway, triggered accusations that it was simply too good to be true&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yuan Li splits his time between two careers: in the winter, he works as a ski instructor; in summer, a&amp;nbsp;photographer. When he took this image, Beijing-based Li was visiting Norway and Iceland with friends, on a trip focused on sightseeing and photographing the&amp;nbsp;aurora borealis. He captured this picture while exploring Sakrisøy, a small island in Lofoten, Norway. In the foreground sits this distinctive yellow homestay; in the background, Olstinden mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It had snowed heavily all day,” Li recalls. “As I was setting up to capture this scene, the snow stopped and the sun came out, which made the perfect environment for taking photos.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/13/yuan-li-best-phone-picture"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Will Farage's Trumpian strategy work against him? He has good reason to believe it won't | Samuel Earle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Reform leader bit back over allegations of racial abuse and revealed his strategy: the best form of defence is dragging everyone else into the mire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the allegations of Nigel Farage’s racist and antisemitic school bullying multiplied, it was hard to keep up with his shifting array of responses. At times, in his evasiveness and discomfort, he has looked like that most un-Farage of things: a nervous politician, anxious not to say the wrong word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, however, he angrily returned to his preferred posture: brimming with indignation at the moral hypocrisy of elites. He lashed out at the BBC’s “&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgexg4lz2q5o"&gt;double standards&lt;/a&gt;” for indulging the allegations, when the broadcaster itself showed racist jokes and skits back in those days. Farage announced it was not he who should apologise, but apparently the BBC that should say sorry “for virtually everything you did throughout the 1970s and 1980s”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/13/nigel-farage-bbc-donald-trump-racism-allegations-politics"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US president finds himself shouldering same burdens of affordability crisis and the inexorable march of time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was supposed to be touting the economy but could not resist taking aim at an old foe. “Which is better: Sleepy Joe or Crooked Joe?” Donald Trump teased &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/trump-pennsylvania-affordability-speech"&gt;supporters in Pennsylvania this week&lt;/a&gt;, still toying with nicknames for his predecessor Joe Biden. “Typically, Crooked Joe wins. I’m surprised because to me he’s a sleepy son of a bitch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exulting in Biden’s drowsiness, the US president and his supporters seemed blissfully ignorant of a rich irony: that 79-year-old Trump himself has recently been spotted apparently dozing off at various meetings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/trump-biden-rivals"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US’s national security strategy, shared last week, claims European immigration will cause ‘civilisational erasure’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you create a foreign policy manifesto for a US president who leads from the gut?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial draft fell to Michael Anton, a Maga firebrand whom officials have called the lead author behind the US’s radical new national security strategy (NSS). The document shocked US allies, warning that immigration to Europe would cause “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe"&gt;civilizational erasure&lt;/a&gt;”, reviving the Monroe doctrine in the western hemisphere, and downgrading the US’s responsibility for great power competition with China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/you-and-me-against-the-world-who-was-behind-trumps-anti-europe-foreign-policy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trump’s racist remarks on Ilhan Omar and Somali immigrants reveals his vision for the US as a white Christian nation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rally on &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/trump-poconos-rally-affordability-hoax/"&gt;affordability&lt;/a&gt; in Pennsylvania on 9 December devolved into a racist tirade when Donald Trump said to the crowd: “We only take people from shithole countries. Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few? … From Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the US representative Ilhan Omar’s hijab as a “little turban”, Trump continued: “She should get the hell out. Throw her the hell out.” His supporters erupted in chants of: “Send her back.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/13/ethnic-cleansing-racism-us-trump-ilhan-omar-somalia"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Veja doesn’t do surveys or freebies, hates greenwashing and Black Friday, and as demand for trainers wanes, it continues to go its own way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the grand hierarchy of Paris fashion, it’s tricky for a brand to stand out. Especially one whose &lt;em&gt;coup de maître&lt;/em&gt; is a goes-with-everything white sneaker. Yet 20 years after Veja first began selling sustainable footwear, it has become the ultimate affordable It brand for scooter-wielding mums, sustainably minded millennials and A-list bigwigs who want to wear their values on their ethical leather-clad feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veja’s co-founder Sébastien Kopp says he doesn’t know if people buy his trainers because of how they are made or because of how they look. The company is fastidious about social and fairtrade practices, “but because we don’t do surveys, we don’t do marketing, we simply don’t know this information”, he says, speaking from Veja’s Paris headquarters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/13/veja-ethical-paris-trainer-worn-a-listers-and-royalty"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Teenager who first scrawled messages on pavement in protest at rightwing government did not expect so many others to follow suit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrawled in chalk on the pavement near a secondary school in eastern Slovakia, the messages were short and to the point: “Enough Fico,” read one, echoing a popular anti-government slogan, while the other joked about the Slovakian prime minister providing sexual favours to Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearing hours before the prime minister, Robert Fico, was due to speak at the school, the messages struck a nerve. Similar comments swiftly began sprouting up across Slovakian pavements in what &lt;a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/slovakias-chalk-revolution-puts-robert-fico-on-the-defensive/"&gt;was labelled &lt;/a&gt; the “Chalk Revolution” by some and “November Chalk Wave” &lt;a href="https://tvpworld.com/90060933/slovakia-protests-fico-challenged-by-student-chalk-wave"&gt;by others.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/13/chalk-revolution-slovakia-fears-return-authoritarian-past"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The OpenAI CEO gushed about the bot’s parental-assistance abilities. Is it really his best child-rearing hack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how does he do it all? Every time I look at the news, Sam Altman’s face seems to be staring back at me. The CEO of OpenAI, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny"&gt;a well-known workaholic&lt;/a&gt;, is constantly in the public eye explaining how AI will probably &lt;a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/abundant-intelligence"&gt;cure cancer&lt;/a&gt; and transform the &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/openais-sam-altman-sees-a-future-with-a-collective-superintelligence"&gt;social contract&lt;/a&gt; and generally change the world. While doing all that he’s reportedly gearing up for OpenAI to file for a stock market listing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/30/openai-1tn-stock-market-float-ipo"&gt;valuing&lt;/a&gt; the company at $1tn, as soon as next year. And he’s also a new dad: Altman and his husband, Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their first child into the world in February. So he’s got a lot on his plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/13/openai-parental-assistance"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Duchess of Sussex says journalistic ethics breached as dad turns to journalist first to break news of leg amputation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Thomas Markle received bad news about his health earlier this month, he immediately texted someone close to him to let them know. The 81-year-old had been admitted to hospital after one leg swelled up and turned black. “Going to lose the leg today,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message was not sent to his son, Thomas, who lives with him in Cebu in the Philippines, nor to his older daughter, Samantha, who is based in Florida. Instead, Markle contacted Caroline Graham, the US editor of the Mail on Sunday, who is based in Los Angeles. It was she who called Markle’s two older children to let them know the news. She &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15360281/estranged-Meghan-Harry-Thomas-Markle-hospital.html"&gt;wrote later&lt;/a&gt; that they were “flabbergasted”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/13/meghan-duchess-sussex-mail-on-sunday-us-editor-rock-solid-friend-father"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;California governor says order pushes ‘grift and corruption’ instead of innovation just hours after president’s dictum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ink was barely dry on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/trump-executive-order-artificial-intelligence"&gt;Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence executive order&lt;/a&gt; when Gavin Newsom came out swinging. Just hours after the order went public Thursday evening, the California governor issued a statement saying the presidential dictum, which seeks to block states from regulating AI of their own accord, advances “grift and corruption” instead of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“President Trump and David Sacks aren’t making policy – they’re running a con,” Newsom said, referencing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/05/trump-david-sacks-ai-crypto"&gt;Trump’s AI adviser and crypto “czar”&lt;/a&gt;. “Every day, they push the limits to see how far they can take it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/13/california-ai-executive-order-trump-gavin-newsom"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forward made an emotional lap of honour at Anfield after a week that put his future at the club in doubt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohamed Salah and Liverpool have put politics to shame by showing what a long week truly looks like. It ended with the Egyptian doing a one-man lap of honour at Anfield, an attempt to rebuild trust with the supporters after creating a ceasefire, if not a complete truce, with Arne Slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past seven days a lot has changed, but one thing remained the same, Salah started a Premier League game on the bench, not that he needed to wait long for a chance to do his talking on the pitch. He would finish with an assist after playing 75 minutes against Brighton in a game in which he desperately wanted to score. Maybe his parade was the beginning of the end, but it felt more like the start of the apology that should continue after the Africa Cup of Nations, giving both parties space to breathe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/13/was-salahs-return-the-beginning-of-the-end-at-liverpool-or-start-of-an-apology"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

That tournament can be seen in hindsight as a watershed for the English game, the first indication that the elite player performance plan (EPPP) and the England DNA project – taking youth football seriously – might be beginning to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youth football is notoriously unpredictable and England’s record in the Under-17 World Cup since shows a failure to qualify and a pair of last-16 exits, but following that 2017 success, England’s senior side have reached two European Championship finals and a World Cup semi-final, while the under-21s have won two European titles. Two previous Golden Ball winners from Under-17 World Cups – Cesc Fàbregas and Toni Kroos – have gone on to win the senior World Cup. Some, such as Landon Donovan, Anderson and Kelechi Iheanacho have had perfectly decent careers. And others have vanished almost entirely: Sani Emmanuel of Nigeria, for instance, won in 2009 then made just 16 senior appearances, 10 of them in the Swiss second tier with Biel-Bienne; while another Nigerian, Kelechi Nwakali, winner in 2015, joined Arsenal but, after a series of loan moves and stints in the lower reaches of the Spanish and Portuguese systems, was kicked out of Barnsley this past summer after returning late for pre-season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/13/phil-fodens-rocky-road-is-proof-that-a-prodigys-promise-is-no-guarantee-of-glory"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week’s weather system dumped 5tn gallons of rain on Washington state – and another one is threatening Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as record-level flood waters that triggered widespread evacuations begin to recede in western &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-state"&gt;Washington state&lt;/a&gt;, residents of the Pacific north-west are bracing themselves for another strong weather system that is likely to swell rivers back to dangerous levels – again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extraordinarily strong system known as an atmospheric river hit the region earlier this week, dropping &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/atmospheric-river-pacific-northwest-flooding-warming-9a175150afae172f2ebca27133abbd5b"&gt;more than a foot of rain&lt;/a&gt; and flooding rivers that stretch across the state toward &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; to dangerous levels. As a result of the nonstop rain, mudslides tore through communities, washing away homes and stranding families on rooftops as they waited for rescue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/atmospheric-river-washington-canada-pacific-north-west"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation signed deal in October, but president says tribe is now trying to exit contract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Native American tribe in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; is facing criticism from other tribal groups after its economic development subsidiary secured a $29.9m federal contract from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to design potential &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement"&gt;Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)&lt;/a&gt; detention facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development entity of &lt;a href="https://www.pbpindiantribe.com/"&gt;the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation&lt;/a&gt; signed the contract to design the detention facilities in October, leading to criticism that the tribal group, which was uprooted from the Great Lakes region to reservation lands north of Topeka, Kansas, in the 1830s, was itself benefiting from forced removals under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/kansas-native-american-tribe-ice-facilities"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real Madrid, who play on Sunday, now trail by seven points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leverkusen’s Terrier hits back-heel volley against Cologne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raphinha struck twice late in the second half as &lt;strong&gt;Barcelona&lt;/strong&gt; secured a hard-fought 2-0 victory over a resolute &lt;strong&gt;Osasuna&lt;/strong&gt; side, extending their lead at the top of La Liga to seven points. Hansi Flick’s men now sit on 43 points, comfortably clear of second-placed &lt;strong&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/strong&gt;, who have a game in hand and play at &lt;strong&gt;Alavés&lt;/strong&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their control of the game, Barcelona struggled to break down Osasuna’s deep defensive block until the 70th minute when Pedri’s incisive pass cut through the visitors’ defence, finding Raphinha in his stride. The Brazilian forward took a controlled touch before unleashing a thunderous strike from the edge of the area, the ball arrowing inside the left post to finally break the deadlock. Raphinha sealed the win in the 86th minute. A deflected cross from Jules Koundé on the right found the Brazilian unmarked at the far post, and he calmly volleyed the ball into an empty net, giving the scoreline a more comfortable look.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/13/european-roundup-atletico-madrid-valencia-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-ligue-1"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Multinational gas corporations are posting huge profits while people on low incomes are skipping meals, not cooling homes and going without medicines because they can’t afford their energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government must implement gas export market controls and avoid options that effectively subsidise gas companies or incentivise new polluting gas production. It’s time for this government to prioritise people over rich gas companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/dec/14/australia-news-live-michelle-rowland-family-travel-entitlements-labor-liberal-coles-woolworths-price-gouging-nsw-vic-wa-fire-weather-heatwave-warnings-albanese-sussan-ley-ntwnfb"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’re reluctant to discuss this with your parents – but doing so might help you shake off the feeling of injustice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am struggling with the different way &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my parents have treated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; me and my brother. My dad started &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a business when I was&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;five&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;worth several million. My brother was invited by my dad to go into the business when he left university. I was not. By th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;en, the business was well established and my &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dad &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stayed on as CEO. My &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dad &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gave my brother 80% of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He will now sell the business and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;realise &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;millions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, meaning he can retire early.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My dad &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;helped me with university fees and house purchases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. He’s told me I will inherit the house and whatever money is left&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; when &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my parents pass away, which is likely to be in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;about 20 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I doubt there will be anything left.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/14/my-dad-has-given-my-brother-80-of-his-business-and-i-feel-horribly-dismissed"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Baronesses Nadine and Ariane de Rothschild at odds over future of Swiss chateau’s priceless contents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three generations of genteel discretion bordering on secrecy, the international banking family the Rothschilds has been riven by rival claims to a multibillion-euro fortune including a vast collection of art masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle now playing out in the courts and media has pitched the 93-year-old senior baroness, Nadine de Rothschild – widow of Edmond de Rothschild, the late scion of the French-Swiss branch of the family – against her daughter-in-law, Ariane de Rothschild, the current baroness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/14/like-a-mini-louvre-two-generations-of-rothschilds-fight-over-treasure-trove-of-artworks"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The jailing of a Sudanese militia leader is an anomaly in a world where Putin, Netanyahu and yes, Hegseth, act without fear of international law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a rare success for international courts struggling to resist a rising tide of official lawlessness. Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman, a leader of the notorious, government-backed Janjaweed militia that committed genocide in Sudan’s Darfur region from 2003 to 2005, was &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-court-darfur-sentencing-abd-al-rahman-ab33a21572ac1a5c2d0ec4ee8547b57e"&gt;jailed for 20 years&lt;/a&gt; last week by the international criminal court (ICC). He had been found guilty on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although hundreds of militia were involved, Abd-al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, is the first person to be convicted of atrocities in Darfur, now again the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/03/blood-spilled-sudan-el-fasher-space-rsf-uae-darfur"&gt;scene of terrible violence&lt;/a&gt; in Sudan’s civil war. The ICC has charged Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s president at the time, with genocide and war crimes. Ahmad Harun, a former minister, faces similar charges. But both men have &lt;a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250129-icc-demands-sudan-hand-over-former-president-al-bashir/"&gt;evaded arrest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/14/icc-sudan-militia-leader-putin-netanyahu-hegseth-international-law"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forget homeschooling, how about taking your family on a perpetual gap year and quitting the nine-to-five? Families who did just that share the hostel horrors and mid-trip meltdowns behind the Instagram feed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was going to be the adventure of a lifetime. Late last year, Josy and Joe Davis decided to quit their jobs, sell their home and pull their two young daughters out of school to travel the world. Though their life in Gloucestershire was good on paper, post-pandemic it had been increasingly feeling like a grind. Josy, 35, a police dispatcher, worked shifts that swung from early morning to late night. Joe, also 35, a logistics manager, was often on call until 10pm. Neither felt as if they could ever switch off – let alone enjoy family time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhausted, Josy caught herself being short with her daughters, Lola and Zara, six and four. “I felt like I spent my days off recovering, rather than actually being present,” she says. Though only in Year 1, Lola was feeling the pressure at school, fretting about where she ranked in the class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/14/the-adventure-can-turn-into-a-disaster-the-digital-nomad-families-worldschooling-their-children"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Her delivery might be stilted – but Truss’ new YouTube show has grand ambitions: a ‘Trump revolution’ in Britain with the help of an influential US conservative ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz Truss, Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister, began the first edition of her YouTube show with a vow to unmask “the evil-doers” attempting to bring down Britain, the US and Europe. She would, she explained, reveal how an “international network of leftists work to subvert democracy and the will of the people”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her bleak monologue, Truss pointed to hope from across the Atlantic. “We’re going to look at the Trump revolution and see how this can be achieved in Britain,” she said. “We’ll be talking to the leading lights of the Maga movement.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/14/steve-bannon-tucker-carlson-and-liz-truss-former-pm-auditions-for-maga"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

You don’t recognise the brand, but the reviews are fantastic – five-star raves that say things such as “this product changed my life” and “this is the greatest air fryer ever”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You buy it, but when it arrives it is clearly cheap and poor quality, and possibly dangerous, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/dec/14/beware-five-star-reviews-fake-online-scam"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a hand in the kitchen, and in lieu of any sous elves, Claire Dinhut – AKA Condiment Claire – picks the ones that will make your feast sing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt, sweet, bitter, acid, umami. While we don’t think to use too much “sweet” before dessert, it can counterbalance and enhance other flavours. Maple syrup is my sweetener of choice during the holidays because it just tastes cozy. Add it to roasted root vegetables or a poultry glaze, and it’s especially tasty in drinks, from hot apple cider to eggnog and even mulled wine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/14/12-condiments-of-christmas-claire-dinhut-condiment-claire"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Another Chance star does Journey at karaoke and gets the party started with Daft Punk. But which Stevie Wonder track would he like played at his funeral?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first song I fell in love with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I grew up in New York City, so the emergence of hip-hop really connected with me when I was a kid.

      <title>‘It’s fun to go to war with God’: Will Sharpe and Paul Bettany on their sweaty, sacrilegious take on Amadeus</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/14/will-sharpe-paul-bettany-interview-amadeus-mozart-salieri</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last time the fierce enmity between Mozart and Salieri was adapted for the screen, it won a best picture Oscar. Now a new TV version turns up the temperature several notches – but will its stars develop a rivalry of their own?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A prodigal son story with God as the father,” is how actor Paul Bettany describes Amadeus, the Peter Shaffer play that became a celebrated film in 1984. Both depict the rivalry between Austrian court composer Antonio Salieri and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/mozart"&gt;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&lt;/a&gt;, a former child phenomenon whose towering talent exposes Salieri as mediocre and stuck in his ways. Salieri, who believes a composer’s gift to be divine, is so affronted by this upstart that he renounces God and sets about destroying Mozart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Amadeus has been remade for TV, with Will Sharpe in the title role and Bettany as Salieri. The series, which begins with Mozart arriving in Vienna in a rickety carriage and promptly throwing up in the street, is written by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/nov/06/the-lazarus-project-joe-barton-interview"&gt;Joe Barton&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Doves and Giri/Haji writer known for his leftfield approach to genre TV. Little surprise, then, that Amadeus takes liberties with the classic period drama, injecting it with modern-day dialogue and gloriously anarchic flourishes. While I won’t divulge the details of an early sex scene between Mozart and a young soprano, safe to say you won’t look at a macaron the same way again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/14/will-sharpe-paul-bettany-interview-amadeus-mozart-salieri"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nnena Kalu’s triumph for neurodivergent art has rattled a few cages. So let me put those carping critics right | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The artist’s winning Turner prize entry has been hailed for its life and energy, but to some dissenting voices its challenge to the status quo is hard to stomach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nnena Kalu is an artist. She is also, as of this week, a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/09/nnena-kalu-first-artist-learning-disability-win-turner-prize"&gt;winner of the Turner prize&lt;/a&gt;. Her work – twisting ribbon forms made from old VHS tape, plastic and strips of fabric – has been praised for its “finesse of scale, composition and colour” (the judges), its “emphasis … on the visual, tactile and experiential in art” (&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/nnena-kalu-turner-prize-2025-winner-b2881799.html"&gt;Mark Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, the Independent) and for being “so full of life and energy … so embodied, so sensuous” (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/09/nnena-kalus-embodied-sensuous-art-worthy-turner-prize-winner"&gt;Adrian Searle&lt;/a&gt;, this newspaper).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being an artist, Kalu also happens to be autistic, has a learning disability and does not communicate verbally as much as many neurotypical people (she is supported by the organisation ActionSpace). These things shouldn’t matter, and perhaps one day they won’t. However, neurodivergent artists have not historically been given much space by the art world, especially not those with learning disabilities. Four years ago, when Project Art Works – a collective of neurodivergent artists – was nominated for the prize, its CEO, Kate Adams, recounted to me how &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/23/turner-prize-rise-of-neurodiverse-art-project-herbert-coventry"&gt;she was told by&lt;/a&gt; a museum professional: “I don’t think it’s right [to have] people with learning disabilities in an exhibition downstairs with an artist of calibre upstairs. They shouldn’t be in the same building.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/14/nnena-kalu-turner-prize-neurodivergent-art"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the exam regulator consults about introducing onscreen exams amid complaints of hand fatigue, a young aspiring journalist goes head-to-head with a self-professed expert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week it was reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/11/gcses-a-levels-exams-england-laptops-2030-ofqual"&gt;students could soon be sitting their end-of-year exams on laptops&lt;/a&gt; after pupils complained of hand fatigue, saying their muscles “are not strong enough”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Ofqual preparing to launch a public consultation on the introduction of onscreen exams, we decided to conduct a test of our own, pitting the Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, a seasoned hack of the pen-and-paper generation, against George Francis Lee, our gen-Z journalist in training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/14/pens-at-the-ready-a-gen-z-trainee-takes-on-the-guardians-scribbler-in-chief"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
