It’s an age-old practice among iTaukei, the Indigenous Fijian people – creating a lifeline to the ocean, a reminder of their roles as traditional custodians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet for decades, controversy over the rights to the Fijian seabed has cast a long cloud over the island nation, which sees a million tourists flock to its shores each year, many to surf the perfect, barrelling reef breaks. It has led to heartache and, at times, violence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/fiji-surfing-cloudbreak-restore-indigenous-rights"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99c9ed4281d9ae704098d6997a84bee3624fc844/173_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=174d40bcba5b667ea28d29c6ddf353bd" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Trump announces plans for new navy warships to be known as ‘Trump-class’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/trump-new-navy-warships</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/trump-new-navy-warships</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:13:58 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;President says the ships will be bigger, faster and a hundred times more powerful than any previous US-built warship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.

Hiding out at a friend’s house in a Beijing suburb, Gao Yingjia and his wife, Geng Pengpeng, rushed downstairs to meet the group of plain-clothed men who said they were police officers. Their son, nearly six, was sleeping upstairs, and Gao and Geng wanted to minimise the ruckus. They knew their time was up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, Gao is in a detention centre in Guangxi province, southern China, charged with “illegal use of information networks”. His arrest was part of the biggest &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/13/china-christians-religious-persecution-translation-bible"&gt;crackdown on Christians in China&lt;/a&gt; since 2018.

What we know on day 1,399&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian forces struck Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa&lt;/strong&gt; late on Monday and damaged port facilities and a ship, the regional governor said, in the second attack on the region in less than 24 hours. Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that emergency crews were tackling the aftermath of the latest attack and that no casualties had been reported but provided no further details. An earlier overnight attack hit port and energy infrastructure in the Odesa region, causing a fire at a major port and disrupting electricity supplies to tens of thousands of people. “Russia is attempting to disrupt maritime logistics by launching systematic attacks on port and energy infrastructure,” deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba said on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Russian general was killed after an explosive device detonated beneath his car&lt;/strong&gt; in what Moscow described as a likely assassination carried out by Ukrainian intelligence services, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/russian-general-fanil-sarvarov-killed-car-bomb-moscow-investigators-say"&gt;reports Pjotr Sauer&lt;/a&gt;. Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, head of the operational training directorate of the Russian armed forces’ general staff, died of his injuries, a spokesperson for Russia’s investigative committee said. “Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder.” Russian Telegram channels with links to the security services reported that Sarvarov’s car exploded while driving along a Moscow street about 7am on Monday. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump has said talks to end the Ukraine war are going “OK”&lt;/strong&gt;, a day after his envoy Steve Witkoff characterised US discussions with Ukrainian and European representatives in Florida as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house"&gt;“productive and constructive”&lt;/a&gt;. “The talks are going along,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday. “We are talking. It’s going OK.” Asked if he planned to speak to Volodymyr Zelenskyy or Vladimir Putin, Trump didn’t say, offering only of the fighting: “I’d like to see it stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy said initial drafts of US proposals for a peace deal met many of Kyiv’s demands&lt;/strong&gt; but suggested neither side in the war was likely to get everything it wanted in talks on a settlement. “Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian president said on Monday of the latest talks with US officials. “There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either.” Trump has been pushing for a peace deal for months but has run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moscow said parallel talks between Russia and the US in Miami at the weekend should not be seen as a breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt;. “This is a working process,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said when asked whether the talks could be seen as a turning point. The Izvestia news outlet cited him as saying in remarks published on Tuesday that discussions were expected to continue in a “meticulous” format and that Russia’s priority was to obtain from the US details of Washington’s work with Europeans and Ukrainians on a possible settlement. He said Moscow would then judge how far those ideas matched what he called the “spirit of Anchorage”, after the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-putin-alaska-meeting-ukraine"&gt;Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy has said residents of a border village taken into Russia by Moscow’s troops had interacted with their neighbours for years&lt;/strong&gt; without incident. The Ukrainian president on Monday confirmed media reports that residents of Hrabovske village – on the Sumy region’s border and home to 52 people – were taken away by Russian troops. “I think they simply didn’t expect Russian troops to simply walk in and take them away as prisoners,” Zelenskyy said. “But that’s what happened.” The Kremlin has not commented on the situation. The Ukrainian army has said it is battling an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/ukraine-war-briefing-kyivs-forces-battle-russian-push-to-break-through-in-sumy-region"&gt;attempted Russian breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; in the north-eastern Ukrainian region, where Russian forces have recently seized several villages near the border.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/23/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-forces-attack-odesa-twice-in-one-day"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/845448aff273e0f4d207105faac545916c5532c6/1113_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=95402ca6aa9a1101778a26d2cf6c1b5f" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Trump complains Epstein files are damaging people who ‘innocently met’ him</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-complains-epstein-files-are-damaging-people-who-innocently-met-him</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-complains-epstein-files-are-damaging-people-who-innocently-met-him</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 02:17:18 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In his first comments since the release, the president expressed sympathy for high-profiles figures, including Bill Clinton, who have come under scrutiny&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has broken his silence on the release of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein"&gt;Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/a&gt; files, complaining that people who “innocently met” the convicted paedophile could have their reputations destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first comments since the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-us-justice-department"&gt;justice department began releasing the materials&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, the US president on Monday expressed sympathy for prominent Democrats who have come under renewed scrutiny over their associations with Epstein.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-complains-epstein-files-are-damaging-people-who-innocently-met-him"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef461379f3602acafc5a836a186c82bca7f5d1ab/364_0_3632_2906/master/3632.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a54a3e5c4909a86cd08cf8a825e666aa" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Democratic states sue to block Trump’s defunding of US consumer watchdog</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/democrats-lawsuit-trump-consumer-financial-protection-bureau</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/democrats-lawsuit-trump-consumer-financial-protection-bureau</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:41:11 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general from 21 states and DC argue defunding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unlawful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coalition of Democratic-led states filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking to prevent Donald Trump’s administration from defunding the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by refusing to request money from the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic attorneys general from 21 states and the District of Columbia filed the lawsuit in federal court in Oregon, arguing that the administration’s decision not to seek additional funding for the US consumer watchdog is unlawful and undermines Congress’ authority under the US constitution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/democrats-lawsuit-trump-consumer-financial-protection-bureau"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/442fae4ee33ee01b57c7ca5b74476c04293881b9/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7b27db10667da9c67e6362c63c3a8981" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Australia’s gun laws have long been the envy of the world.

There’s a long-overdue national focus on antisemitism, something that the Jewish community has been worried about as long as I have been alive. There’s the ongoing concern about national security, and questions about how something like this could have happened. But to me, as a public health expert and Jewish Australian, perhaps the most important conversation we are finally having is the one about guns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts have been &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2021/04/28/new-gun-ownership-figures-revealed-25-years-on-from-port-arthur.html"&gt;warning about guns&lt;/a&gt; for at least a decade. In the wake of the Port Arthur massacre, Australians came together and implemented a suite of measures to curb gun violence across the country. And it worked. Prior to 1996, we saw about one mass shooting a year. In the decades since, we have seen vanishingly few major events, and none with a death toll anywhere close to the shootings of the 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/australia-gun-laws-envy-of-world-must-remain-after-bondi-ntwnfb"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9f5b9687650997980bda7b818b2d8013619da5/212_0_4583_3666/master/4583.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0c5d9573845a869276217d50e45859b5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>New York school board investigates wooden ‘timeout’ box allegations</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/new-york-school-board-wooden-box-claims</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/new-york-school-board-wooden-box-claims</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:00:26 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Governor calls accusations that students with disabilities may have been confined in boxes ‘highly disturbing’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A school district board in upstate New York is investigating school officials amid accusations that the district may have confined elementary school students inside wooden “timeout” boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of the boxes, which resemble tiny padded cells, first spread on social media last week, after a &lt;a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2025/12/16/social-media-posts-about-wooden-box-mohawk-school-prompts-police-investigation/"&gt;former member of the Salmon River school district school board&lt;/a&gt; accused officials of building them to seclude children with disabilities.

Eventually, other countries may go down a similar route&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictions of the demise of letter writing are not new. The invention of the telegraph and the rise of the postcard were both &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1749975515573267"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; as potential threats to a more leisurely, reflective form of communication. Yet by the close of the 20th century, more letters were being sent than ever, as social correspondence began to be supplemented by a boom in business mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Europe’s most tech-savvy society, however, comes ominous news. As of next week, Denmark’s state-run postal service will &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/21/denmark-postnord-postal-delivery-letters-society"&gt;end&lt;/a&gt; all letter deliveries after doing the rounds for 400 years. Around 1,500 jobs are being cut, and the country’s beloved red letterboxes are being sold off. It will still be possible for Danes to send a card or a love letter to someone far away next Christmas, but only via the shops of a smaller private company or a costly home collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For decades, City &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Guilds has helped young people and adults get the skills they need to build their lives. That legacy now&amp;nbsp;feels like it’s hanging by a thread due to the reported £22m cost-cutting drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s just as worrying is the apparent shift from a nonprofit mindset to a profit-driven one. If education becomes just another business, there’s always a risk that profit comes before impact. For many learners – especially those with few other options – vocational training is their path forward.

The WLM was a movement, not an organisation or a party. The national women’s liberation conferences that happened in those years often functioned as national “consciousness-raising” exercises. The most important “votes” were often about adding demands to our growing list, sometimes after long and volatile debates and discussions of emerging issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/collecting-memories-and-stories-of-feminists"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2955d89341cb6ae91dcd9a4b778f8eaea8bc7276/0_1107_4428_3542/master/4428.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=85c7d0555b8348bdcd8fc8a2077f240b" medium="image"/></item><item><title>All children should have access to arts education | Letters</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/22/all-children-should-have-access-to-arts-education</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/22/all-children-should-have-access-to-arts-education</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 17:34:43 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Readers respond to an article by Martin Kettle about the impact of educational inequality on Britain’s cultural sector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Kettle’s article is spot-on (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/18/keir-starmer-music-edward-heath-arts-culture-funding"&gt;Keir Starmer is our most musical prime minister since Edward Heath. He must take up the baton for the arts, 18 December&lt;/a&gt;). The provision of musical education in state schools has declined in the last few decades, and although the pre-Christmas period may give us a chance to hear some lovely music, the reality is that &lt;a href="https://www.suttontrust.com/news-opinion/all-news-opinion/research-reveals-stark-class-inequalities-in-access-to-the-creative-industries/"&gt;most practising musicians&lt;/a&gt; are the product of private schools. Parents of state school pupils may cringe at their children’s performances, with few managing their instruments, and little evidence of input from qualified music teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obituary of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/17/sir-humphrey-burton-obituary"&gt;Humphrey Burton&lt;/a&gt; in the same issue also highlights what we have lost over recent decades in the media, with the BBC Proms and a watered-down Radio 3 doing little to keep the country’s music culture alive. Kettle mentions Alan&amp;nbsp;Bennett’s closing lines of The History Boys – “pass&amp;nbsp;it on, boys” – which urge us to recognise the worth of what this country has inherited. Unfortunately, there is not much serious discussion of contemporary music culture in the Guardian either, to alert us to what is on offer nationally or regionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/22/all-children-should-have-access-to-arts-education"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f64818265b0574af2192cc20dce46d0a2f496b/307_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e38e19183d1e5b12d4b41ae671228b3e" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Portugal’s far-right Chega party ordered to take down posters targeting Roma people</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/portugals-far-right-chega-party-ordered-to-take-down-posters-targeting-roma-people</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/portugals-far-right-chega-party-ordered-to-take-down-posters-targeting-roma-people</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:55:46 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Lisbon court rules the posters could incite hatred and tells party leader Andre Ventura to remove them within 24 hours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leader of Portugal’s far-right Chega party has been ordered to remove street posters attacking the Roma community, after a Lisbon court ruled they were discriminatory and could incite hatred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Ana Barao said the posters’ wording “attacks an ethnic minority” and she gave Andre Ventura 24 hours to remove them or face a daily fine of €2,500 (£2,200) per poster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/portugals-far-right-chega-party-ordered-to-take-down-posters-targeting-roma-people"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdd861d738e3a4d467d80cad47b17f2fdc8ceded/261_0_2608_2086/master/2608.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=31a0eec3342ebef78c9d5f8d11aa8367" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Did you solve it?

News must be something someone somewhere doesn’t want printed, says the old maxim. Well, battalions of interests want to suppress good news: the overwhelmingly Tory or Reform UK press and antisocial media sites don’t want any stories to surface that might do credit to a Labour government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among this deluge of disinformation and malevolence, when asked, a sour and disengaged electorate struggles to think of anything good this government has done. True, the prime minister and his cabinet are partly to blame for failing to tell their story, paint their picture, draw us a map of where they are going and why. They too often do good by stealth, afraid of what the right and business might say if they dare trumpet the strong social justice themes that drive most of what they do. But lay out what the government has done and there it is, plain as a pikestaff. There have been blunders, missteps, bad timing and wrongheaded manifesto pledges, but follow the money to define its identity. What has Labour raised from whom and how was it spent?

But they seem largely to reflect information that has already been made public&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of public outcry and pressure from within the Maga coalition, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;’s justice department released what it called The Epstein Files, with the Trump world’s typical fanfare. A media frenzy ensued. But the “files” that were released by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi"&gt;Pam Bondi&lt;/a&gt;’s Department of Justice left many observers frustrated and confused. The release was partial and heavily redacted; much of the information had already been made public. Media figures were incensed, and members of Congress pledged to push the Trump administration for more. The episode left Washington watchers frustrated. It fueled speculation that Trump, who had long opposed the release of the documents, had something to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was on 27 February, when a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/right-wing-influencers-get-binders-labeled-the-epstein-files-but-downplay-revelations/"&gt;group of 15 rightwing media figures&lt;/a&gt; who had taken a special interest in the Epstein case were summoned to the White House and given white binders labeled “The Epstein Files.” The release was meant to allay pressure from the president’s conspiracy-minded base and neutralize the Epstein issue, which has dogged Trump since the financier sex offender and former close friend of the president died in prison during his first term in 2019. But those who received the binders said that there was little new information in them. The episode only further inflamed tensions and increased the salience of the Epstein issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/22/epstein-files-trump-bondi-justice-department"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e17c7e9d8f1ea8c456495a30fabd025ae8471a/312_0_3120_2496/master/3120.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d6b38412a2c053340068345d1290d887" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Calls for penalties as outrage grows over limited release of Epstein files – US politics live</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/22/reaction-limited-epstein-files-photos-us-politics-latest-updates</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/22/reaction-limited-epstein-files-photos-us-politics-latest-updates</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 13:43:01 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie build bipartisan coalition to hold attorney general Pam Bondi in contempt of Congress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reactions from lawmakers after the document release:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the weekend, top democrat on the oversight committee Robert Garcia and top Democrat on the judiciary committee Jamie Raskin announced they are examining all legal options after the heavily redacted document dump, which they say &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/conservative-response-epstein-release"&gt;violated federal law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

True to form, Putin seemed unperturbed that nearly four years into the war his army had managed to fully occupy only Luhansk, despite having already taken control of more than a third of that region, as well as Donetsk, by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin’s unyielding stance shouldn’t be a surprise.

Marked on the surface by protests, political pendulum swings and spectacular scandals, most of the region has, since the democratisation of the 1980s and 1990s, remained firmly democratic and free of war between states. Though scarred by the violence of armed groups and increasingly powerful criminal organisations, it has, by and large, lived up to its self-assumed moniker of a “zone of peace”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is why this year has felt so jarring. Throughout 2025, the first year of Donald Trump’s second term, analysts have obsessively parsed potential US military incursions into a hemisphere once defined by its unified defence of national sovereignty. But the fixation on whether Washington’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/sheinbaum-un-trump-venezuela-oil-blockade"&gt;escalating pressure&lt;/a&gt; on Nicolás Maduro presages a physical military invasion of Venezuela has distracted from the real story: the larger&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;shift towards direct intervention has already happened, and it has faced remarkably little resistance. More than 100 people have been killed in US maritime strikes that experts characterise as &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/16/us-military-boat-strikes-constitute-extrajudicial-killings"&gt;extrajudicial executions&lt;/a&gt;, and the loudest objections have come not from Latin American presidents or regional organisations, but from the US Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordana Timerman is a journalist based in Buenos Aires.

This summer, the Palestinian journalist &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ll2e_dWCHR8"&gt;broke down&lt;/a&gt; while reporting on starvation in his home town that is now a war zone. A &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/11/israel-gaza-anas-al-sharif-al-jazeera/"&gt;bystander told him&lt;/a&gt;: “Persist, Anas, you are our voice”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But al-Sharif’s popularity in Gaza made him a target. In July, international agencies &lt;a href="https://cpj.org/2025/07/cpj-calls-for-anas-al-sharifs-protection-in-face-of-israeli-smears/"&gt;warned of the danger&lt;/a&gt; he was in as the Israel Defense Forces stepped up online attacks, falsely labelling him a Hamas terrorist. His employer, Al Jazeera, insisted he restrict his reporting to the more protected al-Shifa hospital after his father and many colleagues were killed. In August, a few months short of his 29th birthday, al-Sharif and six others were killed in a direct attack on a media tent next to the hospital. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/11/anas-al-sharif-al-jazeera-journalist-killed-gaza-israeli-airstrike"&gt;In a posthumous post&lt;/a&gt; he said: “If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

While streets glow with fairy lights and shop windows promise that compassion is only a gift-box away, Germany is once again confronted with the unresolved wounds of its recent past. The trap of the season is this: believing that every gesture of regret must be met with mercy. As if forgiveness was a resource available to anyone who is reasonable enough to move on, no matter how atrociously they have been treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is certainly not that simple for the families of the victims of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/neo-nazi-murders-revealing-germanys-darkest-secrets"&gt;National Socialist Underground&lt;/a&gt; (NSU). During the 2000s, the neo-Nazi terror organisation killed 10 people, nine of them immigrants, mostly small business owners, and one policewoman. Because investigators focused on probing the victims’ families and communities rather than on Nazis, the NSU was able to continue murdering without interference. German media reported on the atrocities as &lt;em&gt;die Dönermorde&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/de/nsu-mordserie-warum-auch-die-medien-versagten/a-54856445"&gt;kebab murders&lt;/a&gt;, as if it was some exotic true-crime phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a Guardian Europe columnist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/22/christmas-is-a-season-for-forgiveness-but-is-saying-sorry-enough"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a2c78177ceb2a6c8cffe84fd766a1dfffa3c10/0_0_3055_2444/master/3055.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=632cefeda340d5abc4866f3c20a459a8" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Man jailed for 1,335 years as El Salvador sentences almost 250 MS-13 gang members</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/man-jailed-1335-years-el-salvador-sentences-ms-13-gang-members</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/man-jailed-1335-years-el-salvador-sentences-ms-13-gang-members</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 04:29:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Attorney general’s office also says 10 people received prison terms from 463 to 958 years amid crackdown on gangs under state of emergency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Salvador has announced prison sentences for hundreds of gang members, with some of the convicted receiving terms of hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney general’s office &lt;a href="https://x.com/FGR_SV/status/2002789149418680829"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt; that 248 members of the notorious Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) street gang had received “exemplary sentences” for 43 homicides and 42 disappearances, among other crimes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/man-jailed-1335-years-el-salvador-sentences-ms-13-gang-members"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d967e10db2f4bf44edfdf50236aee01e7129c03d/427_0_4267_3416/master/4267.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=601012227e3dbc28e54703ec77d87cc8" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Slightly haunted but manageable’: new signs cause confusion – and delight – in Christchurch</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/new-zealand-christchurch-spoof-absurdist-road-signs</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/new-zealand-christchurch-spoof-absurdist-road-signs</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 02:28:46 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Six absurdist signs resembling official city council information boards have popped up across New Zealand’s second-largest city&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside an abandoned building in New Zealand’s second-biggest city, a sign reads “slightly haunted but manageable”.

What we know on day 1,398&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian army was battling an attempted Russian breakthrough in the Sumy region&lt;/strong&gt;, it said on Sunday, after reports that Moscow forcibly moved 50 people from a border village there. That marks a renewed Russian advance in the part of the region largely spared from intense ground fighting since Ukraine regained land there in a 2022 counteroffensive. “Fighting is currently ongoing in the village of Grabovske,” Ukraine’s joint taskforce said, adding the troops were “making efforts to drive the occupiers back into Russian territory”. It has also refuted media reports saying Moscow’s troops were in the neighbouring Ryasne village. Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian rights ombudsman said Russian troops forcibly moved about 50 people from Grabovske to Russia. There was no official comment from Russia. On Saturday, the Russian army said it had captured the village of Vysoke, a short distance from Grabovske.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US and Ukrainian envoys issued a joint statement on Sunday saying talks in Miami had been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house"&gt;“productive and constructive”&lt;/a&gt; but did not announce any apparent breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt; in efforts to end the Russian invasion. “Over the last three days in Florida, the Ukrainian delegation held a series of productive and constructive meetings with American and European partners,” Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Ukraine’s top negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said in separate statements on X on Sunday. Witkoff posted: “Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin on Sunday denied that three-way talks between Ukraine, Russia and the US were on the cards. &lt;/strong&gt;Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a day earlier that Washington had mooted the trilateral format, which would mark Moscow and Kyiv’s first face-to-face negotiations in half a year, but the Ukrainian president expressed scepticism that they would lead to progress. Russian news agencies reported Vladimir Putin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, as telling reporters: “At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not in preparation.” Russian representatives have also been in southern Florida for discussions with the US over Ukraine, with a Kremlin envoy saying on Saturday that the talks had been pressing on “constructively”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keir Starmer discussed efforts to achieve a “just and lasting end” to the war in a Sunday call with Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt;, the British prime minister’s office said in a statement after the Florida talks. “The two leaders began by reflecting on the war in Ukraine,” Starmer’s office said in a readout of the call, adding they had discussed the work of the so-called “coalition of the willing” countries that have pledged to support Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/21/kremlin-russia-ukraine-war-end-changes-europe-miami-talks"&gt;renewed its criticism&lt;/a&gt; of efforts by Europe and Ukraine to amend US proposals to end the war in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, saying they did not improve prospects for peace. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/21/kremlin-russia-ukraine-war-end-changes-europe-miami-talks"&gt;Rory Carroll reports&lt;/a&gt; that Putin aide Ushakov told reporters on Sunday that the proposed tweaks to Washington’s plan could prolong the conflict. “I am sure that the proposals that the Europeans and Ukrainians have made or are trying to make definitely do not improve the document and do not improve the possibility of achieving long-term peace,” Ushakov said. He added that he had not seen the exact proposals and that his criticism was “not a forecast”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US intelligence reports continue to warn that Putin has not abandoned his aims of capturing all of Ukraine and reclaiming parts of Europe&lt;/strong&gt; that belonged to the former Soviet empire, Reuters reported six sources familiar with intelligence as saying, even as negotiators seek an end to the war that would leave Russia with far less territory. The most recent of the reports dates from late September, one of the sources said. The intelligence contradicts the Russian leader’s denials that he is a threat to Europe. “The intelligence has always been that Putin wants more,” Mike Quigley, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, told Reuters. “The Europeans are convinced of it. The Poles are absolutely convinced of it. The Baltics think they’re first.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/22/ukraine-war-briefing-kyivs-forces-battle-russian-push-to-break-through-in-sumy-region"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b2bcdc6dfd4345663810361a1c32969b6c34b0a/503_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d18bc20aeb3d7e2e881cf52e6d588760" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Ukrainian and European officials had ‘productive’ talks on ending war, US envoy says</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 23:04:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Witkoff says representatives share goals to stop killing, support Ukraine and end war with Russia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A White House envoy said on Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/ukraine-europe-russia-war-talks-white-house"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555bbdc6be39277f32e3fddf197c2fd669e6c085/216_0_4049_3240/master/4049.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9f89ba00f0b47fc9163b4c6c6ee58d9d" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Louisiana nursing student speaks out during her six-month ICE detention</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/louisiana-nursing-student-ice-detention</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/louisiana-nursing-student-ice-detention</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 22:36:44 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Vilma Palacios, 22, tells local outlet ‘I want my freedom back’ as she may be forced to return to Honduras&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent graduate of the LSU Health New Orleans School of Nursing has been held in an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement"&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt; processing center in Basile, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, for the past six months following her arrest by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt; agents over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vilma Palacios had just recently accepted a position at Touro Infirmary when ICE agents arrested her and transferred her to the processing center in Basile.

For years, Texas has consistently been a top-ranking state in book ban attempts in schools and libraries, according to the American Library Association (&lt;a href="https://www.ala.org/"&gt;ALA&lt;/a&gt;), which publishes annual censorship reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest report for 2024, the organization recorded &lt;a href="https://www.ala.org/news/2025/04/american-library-association-kicks-national-library-week-top-10-most-challenged-books"&gt;821 attempts&lt;/a&gt; to ban library books and other materials in the US. Many of these books are first challenged before banned, and they are often not from the disgruntled parents you may be thinking of. According to the ALA, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/08/majority-of-attempts-to-ban-books-in-us-come-from-organised-groups-not-parents"&gt;most censorship attempts&lt;/a&gt; last year came from “pressure groups and decision makers who have been swayed by them”. The most common reasons for book challenges: objections to sexual content and themes around race and racism, LGBTQ+ and other social justice issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter-us/2025/dec/21/banned-books-gift-ideas-guide"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec1fa14a406713b750e67bfab5d994dccc1db0a7/230_196_3888_3112/master/3888.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=17ba8e494630ed7c1c28099ad8ace4cc" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Mass power outages affect 130,000 in San Francisco and disrupt traffic</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/power-outages-san-francisco-traffic-waymo-taxis-traffic</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/power-outages-san-francisco-traffic-waymo-taxis-traffic</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 20:20:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Traffic signals failed in large portions of the California city while Waymo robotaxis stopped in streets and intersections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A widespread power failure plunged &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; into darkness on Saturday night, disrupting traffic citywide and forcing numerous self-driving &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/waymo"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; taxis to stop abruptly in the middle of streets and intersections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As electricity went out across large portions of the city, traffic signals failed, leaving autonomous vehicles unable to operate as normal. &lt;a href="https://x.com/Jason/status/2002583426067804582?"&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/WhereIsMishaal/status/2002587200681390318"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; shared by users on X showed Waymo robotaxis frozen in place, backing up traffic and creating hazardous conditions for other drivers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/power-outages-san-francisco-traffic-waymo-taxis-traffic"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b07300b04fda20302f02a287c5982bbd10a6b9c/123_0_4945_3956/master/4945.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=3cb6c8db451c09f98e70dcce925bb472" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Miracle’ of Zealandia: chick is born to rare takahē pair thought to be infertile</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/takahe-chick-rare-born-new-zealand</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/takahe-chick-rare-born-new-zealand</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:00:05 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Unexpected arrival is a boon for birdlife in New Zealand, where there are only 500 takahē left&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pair of rare native &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; takahē birds who were believed infertile have stunned staff at the world’s largest urban eco-sanctuary, after hatching a “miracle” chick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roughly seven-week old chick was discovered inside Zealandia, a fully fenced eco-sanctuary 10 minutes from Wellington’s city centre, in November, but its arrival has been a closely guarded secret to ensure its safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/takahe-chick-rare-born-new-zealand"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a46b000014478b347fa9f37025ddef73ec0eb129/0_0_1000_800/master/1000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2a7aa03b5eb4cffc5d8ffd80e866cf40" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Cycling is changing at speed – but is Britain keeping pace?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/21/cycling-changing-at-speed-britain-keeping-pace</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/21/cycling-changing-at-speed-britain-keeping-pace</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 10:00:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Emulating the bike-friendly highways enjoyed by our continental neighbours  will take a lot more money and political will&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Team GB’s velodrome successes at the 2008 Olympics, campaigners and government ministers have confidently predicted that Britain is about to become a nation of cyclists.

Britain must build NHS capacity so that cures become collective goods, not expensive products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/mutationsanddisorders/neutralmutations/"&gt;small fraction&lt;/a&gt; of our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome"&gt;20,000 genes&lt;/a&gt; can cause disease when disrupted – yet that sliver accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c70z8ppjlddo"&gt;thousands of rare disorders&lt;/a&gt;. The difficulty is: what can a doctor do to treat them? In a common condition such as type 2 diabetes, the underlying biology is similar for millions of patients. The doctor can prescribe &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/metformin/"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt;. But with a genetic disorder, the mutation might only affect a small number of people worldwide. In many cases, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/may/23/blood-test-could-speed-diagnosis-rare-diseases-babies"&gt;doctors&lt;/a&gt; won’t even know which mutation is responsible, let alone how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel gene-editing breakthroughs are making &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj38ymeyg4mo"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt;. But therapies are expensive and complex to develop. The cost of bringing any new drug to patients is now around $2bn, in part because, as Brian&amp;nbsp;David&amp;nbsp;Smith notes in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo6ofSBsfA4"&gt;New Drugs, Fair Prices&lt;/a&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;“success rate, from discovery to market, is tiny” and there are approved treatments for “less than 10% of the 8,000&amp;nbsp;diseases that affect humans”. Commercial&amp;nbsp;incentives, he argues, skew innovation towards lucrative cancer drugs and long-term treatments for large populations. Complex gene therapies for very rare conditions are seen as too costly&amp;nbsp;to develop and too small to profit from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/21/the-guardian-view-on-gene-editing-breakthroughs-need-a-new-social-contract"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07b4358bf657bc1620a2bee05ba696f0c6930fdb/487_0_4297_3437/master/4297.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0283460d60809a210b2e7b5214dd6819" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Officer who fatally shot Tamir Rice fired from West Virginia ranger position</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/officer-fired-tamir-rice-shooting</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/officer-fired-tamir-rice-shooting</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 17:34:03 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Timothy Loehmann’s firing is fourth known time in seven years that he left a department following public backlash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Cleveland officer who fatally shot 12-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tamir-rice"&gt;Tamir Rice&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 was fired from his post as a ranger at a West Virginia resort community, the fourth known time in seven years that he left a small department following public backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy Loehmann was fired on Friday from his position at the Snowshoe Resort Community District (SRCD).

Until Brexit, there were diverse chances for students to sample courses, cultures and environments in unfamiliar settings, enriching their experiences in ways that had lasting benefits. As one example, I looked after the UK arm of a consortium of European universities that enabled up to 10 students each year from each of six participating universities from six European countries to attend a 10-day environmental field course in one of these countries. We were able to continue this arrangement without a break for 12 years from 1997, funded almost entirely through Erasmus, so the cost to students was minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field course venue was hosted by rotation, so each university only had to organise the course once every five or six years. Every year, participating students experienced working closely with peers from each country, and were exposed to different ideas and ways of approaching environmental issues, and environments that included the Mediterranean, central Europe and the far north.

Here’s how we are standing against it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump wants us to believe that the “war on Christianity” is spreading across the globe. The US president recently sounded the alarm on the “&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-threatens-nigeria-with-potential-military-action-over-claims-of-christian-persecution"&gt;mass slaughter&lt;/a&gt;” of Christians in Nigeria while threatening a &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-threatens-nigeria-with-potential-military-action-over-claims-of-christian-persecution"&gt;US invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the African nation. We shouldn’t be surprised. This falls right in line with Trump’s ongoing attempts to project Maga Christianity on to the global stage and crack down on religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maga Christianity represents a self-serving, commercialized version of the Christian faith – putting power over service and empathy – and it is everywhere in our federal government. In February, Trump announced a taskforce led by Pam Bondi with the &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-signs-executive-orders-related-to-faith-announcement"&gt;goal of rooting out “anti-Christian” bias&lt;/a&gt;. In September, Trump announced his plans to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/08/trump-says-hell-direct-education-department-to-protect-praying-in-public-school-00550550"&gt;protect prayer in schools&lt;/a&gt;. Later that month, he issued a memorandum &lt;a href="https://time.com/7322106/trump-nspm-7-domestic-terrorism/"&gt;identifying anti-Christianity as a potential driver of terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. These are not just one-off incidents. This is a national effort to push the Maga Christianity agenda on Americans, and we’re already seeing the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doug Pagitt is executive director of Vote Common Good.

The basic answer probably touches on a few aspects of the 21st-century experience. One is the horror and conflict that seem to define the news almost every day. Another centres around the material pressures that increasingly grip supposedly peaceful countries: the never-ending cost of living crisis, and the impossibility for millions of people of a secure job, a dependable home and some halfway viable idea of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else demands a mention: the all-pervading mixture of absurdity, nastiness and anger fostered by the internet. Bigotry runs rampant. What we still rather laughably call social media now seem to operate on the basis that the ideal story mixes wildly improbable elements with the kicking-up of moral outrage (witness that ghoulish “online content creator” Bonnie Blue, who, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/29/1000-men-and-me-the-bonnie-blue-story-review-channel-4-documentary"&gt;having claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, ended the year by &lt;a href="https://spectator.com/article/i-stand-with-nigel-farage/"&gt;announcing her support&lt;/a&gt; for Nigel Farage).

It can’t happen soon enough&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the great joys of Christmas for me has been being able to share my love of The Nutcracker with my son. Last year, I took him to see a child-friendly version by the Let’s All Dance ballet company. The look of wonderment and recognition on his face when the music started up is a memory that I’ll treasure for ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll confess that the idea of taking a then two-year-old to a ballet had struck me as faintly ridiculous, one of those painfully middle-class-coded things I find myself doing as a parent (see also Mini Mozart). That kind of thinking, though, is in itself elitist, because who says ballet, or classical music, should be only for rarefied audiences? The popularity of The Nutcracker, not to mention shows such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/17/howard-blake-bill-alexander-snowman"&gt;The Snowman&lt;/a&gt;, which has been running at London’s Peacock theatre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/18/this-weeks-new-dance"&gt;28 years&lt;/a&gt;, is testament to how children respond joyfully, and instinctively, to dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

How can Britain ignore Beijing’s provocations and human rights abuses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK pushed hard to secure the release of Jimmy Lai, the newspaper publisher and British citizen who was a leading light in Hong Kong’s brutally suppressed pro-democracy movement. So, too, did press freedom and human rights campaigners. But the Beijing-appointed high court judges in the former colony convicted him anyway, finding Lai guilty last week on fake charges of trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-judges-national-security-charges"&gt;“destabilise” the Chinese Communist party&lt;/a&gt; (CCP). For Xi Jinping, China’s dictator-emperor, there is no greater crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesting to China’s ambassador, the UK’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/uk-condemns-hong-kongs-politically-motivated-targeting-of-jimmy-lai-after-conviction"&gt;condemned the trial&lt;/a&gt; as “politically motivated”. She’s right, of course – but her angry words will make no difference. Beijing’s contempt for Britain’s views is as painfully obvious as the UK’s weakness and indecision in the face of Chinese hubris.

Still, I’m convinced that I am the true spirit of the festive season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most families have their own unique festive rituals, and my husband and I have spent this December in the manner traditional to us: squabbling. He is fully invested in every possible aspect of the season of goodwill. On the big day itself, he wears his cracker crown until it breaks, like a metaphor; I usually don’t bother unfolding mine, let alone putting it on. We’ve been married for 15 years, and weathered many storms together, but at the moment our relationship is particularly challenging. How do you cope when you’re Christmas incompatible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my defence, I’m not bah-humbugging at merely a rational amount of yuletide spirit. My husband is perpetually jolly as standard – it’s always the first word anybody I introduce him to uses to describe him afterwards. He’s relentlessly cheerful, endlessly enthusiastic and can be relied upon to put a positive spin on any situation. If we were trapped in a burning building, the last words I’d hear would be, “At least we’re not cold!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What we know on day 1,397 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian drones hit an oil rig at Russia’s Filanovsky field in the Caspian Sea – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more than 700km (435 miles) from Ukraine’s nearest border&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as the military patrol ship Okhotnik and other facilities, Ukraine’s military general staff said in a statement on Saturday. It said the ship was patrolling near the platform. The extent of the damage was being assessed. The attack continues Kyiv’s recent campaign of &lt;strong&gt;strikes on Russia-linked maritime targets far from Ukrainian territory&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian drones struck a &lt;strong&gt;radar system in the Krasnosilske area of Crimea&lt;/strong&gt;, which Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine’s SBU security service claimed two Russian fighter jets were also destroyed at an airfield in occupied Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Thursday, Russian forces have at least five times hit a &lt;strong&gt;bridge on the Dniester River near the village of Mayaky&lt;/strong&gt;, south-west of Pivdennyi in Ukraine’s Odesa region, according to the deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba. The bridge, which connects parts of the region divided by the river and sea inlets, is the &lt;strong&gt;main transport route westward to border crossings with Moldova&lt;/strong&gt;, and is not operational now. The route &lt;strong&gt;accounted for about 40% of fuel supplies to Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, Kuleba said. Ukrainian authorities have set up a pontoon bridge and re-routed logistics through other regions, securing civilian and freight logistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;death toll rose to eight &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from a Russian strike on Pivdennyi port&lt;/strong&gt;. Geneva-based vegetable oil producer Allseeds said &lt;strong&gt;three tanks storing sunflower oil&lt;/strong&gt; at the site were set ablaze in Pivdennyi, and &lt;strong&gt;one of its workers was killed while two were injured&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military said its forces on Saturday &lt;strong&gt;fought back more than 60 attacks on Pokrovsk&lt;/strong&gt;, which is under heavy Russian siege. Across the combat zones in Ukraine, “the Russian invaders carried out 42 airstrikes, dropping 101 guided bombs. In addition, they used 1,684 kamikaze drones and carried out 2,467 attacks on our military positions and settlements.” In the Kharkiv region city of Izium, &lt;strong&gt;two people were killed by guided bomb strikes&lt;/strong&gt;, said the state emergency service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia reported &lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian drone attacks on its Belgorod region as well as an attack on facilities in the Kursk region&lt;/strong&gt; that left about 5,000 people without electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House offered to chair face-to-face talks between officials of the US, Russia and Ukraine, as the &lt;strong&gt;Trump administration continued to cast about for a peace deal&lt;/strong&gt;. “America is now proposing a trilateral meeting with national security advisers – America, Ukraine, Russia,” said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine would back the proposal, he said, if it facilitated more exchanges of prisoners and paved the way for meetings of national leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy said Ukraine stood for proposals that would leave the frontline where it is without Ukraine having to give up territory it still controls in the industrial region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. “For me, &lt;strong&gt;the fair version is we stand where we are now standing&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said. US negotiators met Russian officials in Florida on Saturday, following on from US talks on Friday with Ukrainian and European officials. It was suggested the talks would continue on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/21/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-oil-rig-hit-in-caspian-sea-over-700km-from-ukraine"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9808e8d5338af62df3dd89d1f74820165d5462e7/515_0_5883_4705/master/5883.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=cc0fc4e5fac1d35d68f7399dd4751fba" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Outrage and legal threats: Trump justice department slammed after limited Epstein files release</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/trump-justice-department-legal-threats-epstein-files-release</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/trump-justice-department-legal-threats-epstein-files-release</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:59:21 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers voice frustration over heavy redactions and the apparent removal of files from government website &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;’s justice department was hit with legal threats and scathing outrage after authorities released a limited, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-us-justice-department"&gt;heavily redacted trove&lt;/a&gt; of Jeffrey Epstein files in an apparent violation of the law mandating the near-complete disclosure of these documents by Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The justice department’s document dump this afternoon does not comply with Thomas Massie and my Epstein Transparency Act,” Ro Khanna, the California Democratic congressman who co-authored the law requiring full disclosure of all Epstein files by 19 December, said in &lt;a href="https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/2002150152690348438"&gt;a video statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/trump-justice-department-legal-threats-epstein-files-release"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61b2984b93810628bd47c0b7af1ab09000b0d249/514_429_3079_2464/master/3079.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=4430eb66f510c40c11a7bb9e77683c1a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>US intercepts second merchant vessel off coast of Venezuela in international waters</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/us-second-merchant-vessel-venezuela</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/us-second-merchant-vessel-venezuela</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 20:15:00 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Move comes days after Trump announces ‘blockade’ of sanctioned oil tankers and US seizes tanker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US forces on Saturday stopped a second merchant vessel off the coast of Venezuela in international waters, according to two US officials, the Associated Press reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes days after Donald Trump announced a “blockade” of all sanctioned oil tankers coming in to and out of the South American country and follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast"&gt;seizure&lt;/a&gt; by US forces of an oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast on 10 December.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/us-second-merchant-vessel-venezuela"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e21e05701712f4f06c3edce42d7dfb2a56de069/374_0_4302_3441/master/4302.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=90ff4bec0a55d0b5fcb7fea03927b3e1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Snails on a plane: Australia flies rescue mission to Norfolk Island for a tiny, critically endangered species</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/campbell-keeled-glass-snail-translocation-norfolk-island</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/21/campbell-keeled-glass-snail-translocation-norfolk-island</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 19:00:39 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The Campbell’s keeled glass-snail is officially extinct, but researchers have  ‘high hopes’ that translocation will allow the population to thrive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/sign-up-for-the-clear-air-australia-environment-newsletter-with-adam-morton?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;Sign up for climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s free Clear Air newsletter here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a grey day in early June, a commercial plane landed at Norfolk Island Airport in the South Pacific.

We are resuming our live coverage of the Department of Justice’s long-awaited release of documents from the federal investigations into &lt;strong&gt;Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/strong&gt;, the late sex offender who socialized with &lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; for more than 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first cache of ‘Epstein Files’ were released on Friday evening after months of delay and stalling from the Trump administration. Deputy attorney general &lt;strong&gt;Todd Blanche&lt;/strong&gt; told Fox News that he expected the department to release several hundred thousand more files in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing documents &amp;amp; ‘over-redactions’:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khanna&lt;/strong&gt; said that the partial “document dump this afternoon does not comply” with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and told CNN, adding: “The most important documents are missing.” Those documents are a draft 60-count federal indictment outlining charges against Epstein, and a detailed memorandum summarizing the evidence that was disregarded by the US attorney, &lt;strong&gt;Alex Acosta&lt;/strong&gt;, who chose instead to offer Epstein an extraordinarily lenient plea deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/epstein-files-explode-open-doj-details-discovery-powerful-figures-more-than-1200-victims"&gt;a Fox News report&lt;/a&gt;, the justice department redacted the names and identifiers of victims and “the same redaction standards were applied to politically exposed individuals and government officials”. &lt;strong&gt;Massie&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2002176606664573208"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on social media that the attorney general, Pam Bondi, could be convicted by a future justice department of obstruction of justice if she violated a provision of the law by redacting the names of government officials. Massie noted that the law explicitly states that no documents may be “withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official”. &lt;strong&gt;Blanche&lt;/strong&gt; later called Fox News to insist that the justice department is “not redacting the names of any politicians”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the justice department said it may have “over-redacted” the Epstein files in order to “protect victims”. &lt;strong&gt;Jay Clayton&lt;/strong&gt;, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in court on Friday that it had blacked out the faces of almost every woman photographed with Jeffrey Epstein, citing issues determining who was a victim of the paedophile. Mr Clayton reportedly noted the approach could be “over-redaction”, but blamed it on the 30-day timeframe Congress set for releasing the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is in the Epstein files?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The files that were viewable included images of Epstein socialising with an array of prominent figures, including entertainers like &lt;strong&gt;Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Diana Ross,&lt;/strong&gt; and the entrepreneur &lt;strong&gt;Richard Branson&lt;/strong&gt;. The images also show former British royal &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor &lt;/strong&gt;and his ex-wife &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Ferguson&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Mandelson&lt;/strong&gt;, who was sacked from his job as the UK’s ambassador to the US earlier this year, could be seen in a picture with Epstein who is being presented with a giant birthday cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were many images of &lt;strong&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/strong&gt;, but very little about president Trump in the portion of the files released on Friday. But one seemingly innocuous snapshot of Epstein’s bookcase did include a reminder that he and Trump were once close. The image showed Epstein’s copy of Trump’s 1997 book, Trump: &lt;em&gt;The Art of the Comeback&lt;/em&gt;, which the New York Times&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/us/politics/trump-epstein-birthday-book.html"&gt; reported in July&lt;/a&gt; included an inscription from Trump reading: “To Jeff – You are the greatest!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/20/jeffrey-epstein-files-released-donald-trump-latest-news-photos-updates-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d0e4a8fad4832c116b12fd7e435bcba0a21271/321_366_2331_1864/master/2331.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a2692d51eac8b3412ff9ee7e66a4ce0c" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Each year, word of the year gets darker. ‘Six-seven’ may be annoying – but it’s bucked that trend | Coco Khan</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/20/words-of-the-year-six-seven-teenagers</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/20/words-of-the-year-six-seven-teenagers</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 10:00:26 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Some might regard it as ‘brain rot’, but the first word of the year just for tweens and teenagers could be the most hopeful development of 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What connects the word “vape”, the crying-laughing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/24/tears-of-joy-emoji-worst-gloat-about-human-suffering"&gt;emoji&lt;/a&gt; and the phrase “squeezed middle”?

Will they sit in the permanent collection, along with 2005’s “podcast” and 2015’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/05/binge-watch-2015-word-of-the-year-collins"&gt;binge-watch&lt;/a&gt;”?

The residents of the housing estates surrounding Battersea power station in London, including the Patmore where I was raised, faced that prospect when, in 2012, a consortium of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/07/battersea-power-station-preferred-bidders"&gt;Malaysian investors&lt;/a&gt; bought the derelict power station, decommissioned since 1983, for £400m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years earlier, David Cameron had launched the Conservative manifesto in the ruined power station.

Tourists buy mulled wine and churros at the Christmas market outside the Bourse, the old stock exchange, now repurposed as a beer museum. A few people drink coffee on cafe terraces. Up and down the length of the 650-metre-long space, people come and go, bikes and scooters weaving in and out of the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year, this scene will look somewhat different: bikes and scooters will be banned from this 18,000-sq-metre pedestrian zone for most of the day. People on two wheels will be allowed to ride only between 4am and 11am. At all other times, they must dismount and push their vehicle up the street, or face a fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/brussels-bike-ban-plan-for-pedestrian-zone-dangerous-and-absurd"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a632d575d4d9c6e53d44fffc8b7993e3e1b76254/0_58_3544_2836/master/3544.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=caf3cc379947b3d4a97dc13a8e1b1fca" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The volunteers putting their bodies between Israel settlers and a Palestinian village</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/the-volunteers-putting-their-bodies-between-israel-settlers-and-a-palestinian-village</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/the-volunteers-putting-their-bodies-between-israel-settlers-and-a-palestinian-village</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 07:00:25 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In the Jordan valley, teenage settlers drive herds of goats into a Palestinian community in a bid to force families out – volunteers are trying to hold the line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a daily onslaught.

Just don’t mention beef tomatoes or buffalo wings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of what you eat is sausages. I mean, if we’re going to get literal about it. Sausage derives from the Latin &lt;em&gt;salsicus&lt;/em&gt;, which means “seasoned with salt”. You might think of a sausage as a simple thing, but on this reading it is everything and nothing, a Borgesian meta-concept that retreats as you approach it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From another perspective, a sausage is an offal-filled intestine, or the macerated parts of an electrocuted or asphyxiated pig or other animal – generally parts that you wouldn’t knowingly eat – mixed with other ingredients that, in isolation, you might consider inedible. For some reason, it is seldom marketed as such.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/20/sausage-meat-lobby-europe-plant-based-name"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b2a57d265d6595899b0163100257d64ff58e207/0_600_2771_2217/master/2771.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=209ccde737a21de9e110fcabfeb393b5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Was 2025 the year that business retreated from net zero?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/20/was-2025-the-year-that-business-retreated-from-net-zero</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/20/was-2025-the-year-that-business-retreated-from-net-zero</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 05:00:20 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;From retailers to banks, carmakers to councils, the bold pledges for carbon-neutral economies are being watered down or scrapped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost a year since Donald Trump returned to the White House with a rallying cry to the fossil fuel industry to “drill baby, drill”, a backlash against net zero appears to be gathering momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More companies have retreated from, or watered down, their pledges to cut carbon emissions, instead prioritising shareholder returns over climate action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/20/was-2025-the-year-that-business-retreated-from-net-zero"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b09b001d3eef92a03e30674799947d7384f81b2/468_0_4680_3744/master/4680.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1c5443dd945a5c45f95b604919294d9f" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘From her pen sprang unforgettable females’: 16th-century Spanish author’s knight’s tale given reboot</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/16th-century-spanish-author-beatriz-bernal-knights-tale-given-reboot</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/16th-century-spanish-author-beatriz-bernal-knights-tale-given-reboot</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 05:00:21 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Beatriz Bernal’s pioneering novel features brave, chivalrous women who ride dragons and her adapter wants his illustrated version to reach young readers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty years before a gaunt and deluded nobleman from La Mancha was overdosing on tales of derring-do, visiting his madness on those around him – and single-handedly rewriting the rules of fiction – the deeds of another heroic knight had already made literary history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though completely eclipsed by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes"&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/a&gt;, Cristalián de España, which was first published in 1545, has a unique claim to fame.

What we know on day 1,396&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Russian missile attack late on Friday&lt;/strong&gt; on infrastructure around Ukraine’s Black Sea port of &lt;strong&gt;Pivdennyi in the Odesa region killed seven people and injured 15&lt;/strong&gt;, Ukrainian officials said. It comes after Ukraine said it had &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/ukraine-attacks-russian-shadow-tanker-off-libyan-coast"&gt;attacked a Russian “shadow fleet” tanker with aerial drones&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of Libya on Friday, in the first such strike in the Mediterranean since Moscow’s full-scale invasion. Odesa, a focal point of Ukrainian grain and other exports, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba said Ukraine was talking to Moldovan authorities to find alternative routes away from the affected area so trucks and passengers could cross the border. In Moldova, authorities set up temporary camps at border crossings to provide shelter and food for travellers making their way to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy said a &lt;strong&gt;€90bn loan from the EU to Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/ukraine-deal-latest-europe-leaders-loan-zelenskyy"&gt;that was secured on Friday&lt;/a&gt; to meet urgent financial needs amounted to “significant support that truly strengthens our resilience”, adding: “It is important that Russian assets remain immobilised and that Ukraine has received a financial security guarantee for the coming years.” The loan will last for two years and Kyiv would only repay it if and when Russia paid war reparations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin intends to capture all of Ukraine and reclaim parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire&lt;/strong&gt;, according to six sources familiar with US intelligence. The reports present a starkly different picture from that painted by Donald Trump and his Ukraine peace negotiators, who have said Putin wants to end the conflict. The most recent of the reports dates from late September, according to one of the sources. The intelligence also contradicts the Russian leader’s denials that he is a threat to Europe, and comes as Putin says “the ball is now fully and completely” in the court of Kyiv and its western allies regarding an end to the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US secretary of state, &lt;strong&gt;Marco Rubio, on Friday promised not to force Ukraine into any agreement to end Russia’s invasion&lt;/strong&gt; as European allies joined fresh talks in Miami. The weekend talks come as Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, in an annual news conference vowed to press ahead with his military offensive in Ukraine. Donald Trump’s envoys have pressed a plan in which the US would offer security guarantees to Ukraine, but Kyiv would likely be expected to surrender some territory. Rubio said both sides had to agree: “We can’t force Ukraine to make a deal. We can’t force Russia to make a deal. They have to want to make a deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubio said he may join the &lt;strong&gt;talks in Miami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on Saturday, which are being led by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner&lt;/strong&gt;, and will include top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov and officials from Britain, France and Germany. Umerov said he would be “acting clearly in line with the priorities defined by the [Ukrainian] president: security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin’s special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is also heading to Miami&lt;/strong&gt; to meet Witkoff and Kushner, a Russian source told Reuters. The source said that any meeting between Dmitriev and the Ukrainian negotiators had been ruled out. Witkoff and Kushner have been working with EU and Ukrainian negotiators on an amended version of a peace plan, earlier drafts of which were criticised by the EU and Ukraine as being slanted toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/20/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-missiles-strike-port-near-odesa-killing-seven-officials-say"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09de26b0adc285c583550cb7dab918ebeb9a3885/382_84_1495_1196/master/1495.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2a5c5d9175a84c15cb0fdade4441c65b" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Trump over-promises and under-delivers with heavily redacted Epstein cache</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/doj-epstein-files-release-redacted-trump</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/doj-epstein-files-release-redacted-trump</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 00:05:59 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;‘Most transparent’ administration has slow-walked and stonewalled – the incomplete release smells of a cover-up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-released-trump-administration"&gt;Epstein documents release – live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disappointment was palpable.

Pretending this is not happening is not good enough&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1981, IRA and other republican prisoners went on hunger strike in Northern Ireland, demanding the restoration of their political status. Ten would die; extraordinarily, their leader, Bobby Sands, had been elected as an MP by the time of his death. Margaret Thatcher took a hardline public stance. But by the end, behind the scenes, the government &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/04/northernireland.northernireland"&gt;was looking for an exit&lt;/a&gt;, and public opinion had shifted significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lives of the Palestine Action-affiliated remand prisoners &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/20/palestine-action-activists-awaiting-trial-in-prison-to-go-on-hunger-strike"&gt;now on hunger strike&lt;/a&gt; are at growing risk. On Friday, two reached day 48 without food. (In 1981, one IRA prisoner – 29-year-old Martin Hurson – died on the 46th day.) Twenty-year-old Qesser Zuhrah is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/16/palestine-action-hunger-strikers-may-die-without-lammy-intervention-lawyers-say"&gt;being treated in hospital&lt;/a&gt; after she reportedly collapsed at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey. Amu Gib, 30, has also been treated. Three more have refused food for more than 40 days and another, who has diabetes, is eating only every other day. Two others have now ended their protest, one after hospitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Among them, my own custom of devoting the last column before Christmas to reasons to be hopeful. In recent years, amid war and bloodshed, that task has been especially challenging – and this week was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began with the news from Bondi beach, where 15 people were gunned down and dozens more injured, most of them Jews celebrating the festival of Hanukah. That came just two-and-a-half months after &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/02/six-minutes-of-terror-how-manchester-synagogue-attack-unfolded"&gt;the deadly attack on Heaton Park synagogue&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester, on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur.

It is part of so-called “beaver bombing” across Europe over the last 25 years, a form of civil disobedience whereby people, frustrated at what they see as expensive, obstructive bureaucracy around species reintroduction, take matters into their own hands and release animals without engaging with conservation bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bureaucracy can be alternatively framed as necessary ecological safeguards. Curiously, beavers popping up in Britain, Spain, Belgium, Italy and elsewhere can all be genetically linked to the Bavarian population. We have good evidence that pine martens, polecats, wildcats and various amphibian and butterfly species have been released across the UK&amp;nbsp;without engagement with the&amp;nbsp;relevant authorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/19/the-rise-of-beaver-bombing-across-europe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61cbbd6e6ffb4d3064292b904fc6360ba2fa8fc3/219_0_2338_1871/master/2338.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=42a75e267e8210cfb81a0da6c431de41" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Unaccompanied children being pressed to return to their countries by US border officials</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/unaccompanied-children-trump-self-deport</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/unaccompanied-children-trump-self-deport</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Exclusive: federal document reveals children arriving as undocumented immigrants being threatened with detention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Border officials are pressuring unaccompanied children who arrive in the US as undocumented immigrants to quickly agree to return to their countries of origin, even if they express fear for their safety there – or else face “prolonged” detention and other consequences, a federal government document reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document, which emerged as an attachment in a court filing made by immigration attorneys, is understood to be presented or read to children within the first few days of them entering the US while they are still in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), before they can see any relatives in the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/unaccompanied-children-trump-self-deport"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473664ce8a9a033c7254ff69938d8a5bd5873df/331_781_4014_3212/master/4014.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=43e069ec3e43a408b07fe78702189ea1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Are sweet potatoes healthy?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/19/are-sweet-potatoes-healthy</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/19/are-sweet-potatoes-healthy</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;This holiday staple is also one of the world’s oldest crops – here’s what to know about adding sweet potatoes to your diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potatoes can be roasted, mashed, fried and pied – you might have eaten them so often that they feel old hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, they are – sweet potatoes count among the world’s oldest domesticated crops.

But not simply because racial intolerance has become newly contagious. It is because of a peculiarly British paradox: we abhor racists yet often excuse&amp;nbsp;racism because we too often want to believe that only&amp;nbsp;racists are capable of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But racism is no more dependent on racists for its existence than it is reliant on malice to find expression. Too few among the general public are cognisant of this and too many politicians appear to be ignorant of it, which is why so many can be wooed by a hardline anti-immigration stance without recognising the extent to which it employs racist tropes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/we-abhor-racism-in-britain-but-refuse-to-recognise-where-it-comes-from"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5a9bf60e0ea1bbd580260dec7728af4da58afa/799_0_6832_5464/master/6832.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0307c98b6a1f07de79be6f43ada55704" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Europe mustn’t build its own house of dynamite | Letters</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/europe-mustnt-build-its-own-house-of-dynamite</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/europe-mustnt-build-its-own-house-of-dynamite</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:12:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;A compelling model for sustainable security without nuclear deterrence or offensive military capabilities could be developed, writes &lt;strong&gt;Dr Ian Davis&lt;/strong&gt;.

To safeguard its security and values, Europe must act swiftly to prepare for a post‑Nato Europe. Most Europe-centric alternative proposals approach the issue from a traditional hard security perspective, not fully severing Nato ties but prioritising EU-led decision-making, often starting as a “Nato-plus” complement before evolving into a standalone entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such thinking also generally proposes major increases in military spending, an EU-based command structure independent of the US, integrated European military capabilities, a shared European nuclear deterrent, and binding mutual defence commitments.

I should know. When I was chief whip, nothing united a party quite as much as a defection. Old enemies call a truce from their daily hostilities to turn all the available ire on the traitor in their midst. Ask Shaun Woodward, the former Conservative MP for Witney &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/dec/19/labour.labour1997to99"&gt;who legged it to Labour in 1999&lt;/a&gt; while making all sorts of rather grand demands in the process. He was blackballed by his original party for such a flagrant act of opportunism, and hated by his new family as someone never to be entirely trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember the shock and anger when entering the chamber in April 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68913287"&gt;to see Dan Poulter seated uncomfortably behind Keir Starmer&lt;/a&gt; for PMQs. Not only had we had no warning, but as he had barely even attended parliament in anyone’s recent memory, we weren’t quite sure whether Labour would know who he was. Only weeks later, Dover diehard Natalie Elphicke &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/08/conservative-mp-natalie-elphicke-defects-to-labour-party"&gt;pulled the same stunt&lt;/a&gt; and also promptly disappeared from view. How she could have left friends and whips a few hours earlier with the impression that she was voting with the government that day, I am not quite sure&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It seems that such niceties matter little to the “defector community”, any more than loyalty to the party, volunteers, voters and supporters who gave them such a privileged position in the first place.

Turning her head could make her lightheaded or, worse, spark a devastating headache. She fought to remember basic daily tasks. Driving became impossible, as did the idea of continuing to work as a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at Buffalo Therapy Services, a clinic near her home in the suburb of East Aurora, New York, Buckley felt hopeful. For more than a year, she worked diligently with the clinic’s cognitive and occupational therapists. They took her into the darkened staff room and flashed red and green lasers so she could relearn the difference. They taught her to write everything down, to help with her lack of short-term memory. They made a list of what she wanted to accomplish, and told her: “We’re not going to work on what you can’t do any more. We’re going to work on what you can do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/19/healthcare-cuts-clinics-buffalo"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8c30ba0a8d67cc7894b6de3f1217b288b55fb5a/0_613_4757_3806/master/4757.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=3fcab7a943c5621669f8d3704a846f9d" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Revealed: FBI opened domestic terrorism investigations into anti-ICE activity across US</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/fbi-terrorism-investigations-anti-ice-activity</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/fbi-terrorism-investigations-anti-ice-activity</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:00:05 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Internal report shared with Guardian shows FBI has launched cases in 23 regions, some linked to Trump memo on thwarting ‘terroristic activities’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI has launched “criminal and domestic terrorism investigations” into “threats against immigration enforcement activity” in at least 23 regions across the US, according to an internal report shared with the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-page FBI document, dated 14 November, says some of the investigations are related to the “countering domestic terrorism” &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/trump-presidential-memorandum-political-violence"&gt;memo issued by Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/fbi-terrorism-investigations-anti-ice-activity"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a013038f680b595c81fd11efca424a31e7f711/479_0_6139_4912/master/6139.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=448f44afe71a9140944f51cc9a3ece84" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Like Maga disciples’: meet the Trump envoys raising eyebrows in Europe</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/trump-european-envoys-charles-kushner-andrew-puzder-stacey-feinberg-kimberly-guilfoyle</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/trump-european-envoys-charles-kushner-andrew-puzder-stacey-feinberg-kimberly-guilfoyle</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:07:56 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;US president has been blatant in his appointment of relatives, close friends and big donors – almost none of whom have diplomatic experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your goal is to “help Europe correct its current trajectory” because it is “weak”, “decaying” and facing “civilisational erasure”, your choice of highly trained operatives for the mission is plainly of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Donald Trump’s case they include: a former burger magnate; his eldest son’s former fiancee; the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team; a producer of Broadway musicals; PayPal’s co-founder; and a convicted felon who is also his son-in-law’s father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/trump-european-envoys-charles-kushner-andrew-puzder-stacey-feinberg-kimberly-guilfoyle"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4024c6238ac64e1ba0d0b9dfc4cb4ad3b94de58/431_0_4240_3392/master/4240.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8237457869cdde718ed0ad73322de071" medium="image"/></item><item><title>First Thing: Brown University shooting suspect died from self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials say</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/first-thing-brown-university-shooting-suspect-died-from-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound-officials-say</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/first-thing-brown-university-shooting-suspect-died-from-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound-officials-say</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:38:41 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Claudio Neves Valente, who was found dead in a storage facility, also killed an MIT professor.

Meanwhile, upstate New York and other parts of New England were on the colder side of the system and received significant snow accumulations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/19/weather-tracker-early-snowfall-new-york-storm-rips-down-lights-spain"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a10c34a7bc67bcf8f3b4e47ef75af19041acccc3/362_0_6830_5464/master/6830.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f39fe34c940d856060bdd69f2d8a0a74" medium="image"/></item><item><title>UK Foreign Office victim of cyber-attack in October, says Chris Bryant</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/19/uk-foreign-office-victim-cyber-attack-october-</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/19/uk-foreign-office-victim-cyber-attack-october-</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 08:00:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Minister says ‘any individual’ at low risk from hack, while Sun reports Chinese cyber gang responsible for breach &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office was hacked in October, the minister Chris Bryant has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant, a trade minister in Keir Starmer’s government, told Sky News there was a low risk to “any individual” from the cyber-attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/19/uk-foreign-office-victim-cyber-attack-october-"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3ccd425b125b2748a99b638f980b805674ad23e/395_0_3335_2668/master/3335.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c642ab8acb9769cbaed1c3d58fffd393" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Finally, Labour is finding its nerve and getting Britain’s bad Brexit deal undone | Polly Toynbee</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/19/labour-brexit-undone-finding-nerve-keir-starmer</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/19/labour-brexit-undone-finding-nerve-keir-starmer</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 08:00:55 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Rejoining Erasmus should just be a first step – as the economic evidence piles up, the need for closer ties with Europe could not be clearer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Month by month, Labour is bringing us closer to Europe.

Sign up here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rikki Held grew up on her family’s ranch in Montana, watching the land transform amid the climate crisis. The Powder River, which runs through the property, has sometimes dried up during drought, leaving crops and livestock without water. At other points, rapid snowmelt and heavy rains have caused flooding and eroded riverbanks, making the land difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the 24-year-old and a group of other young people won a groundbreaking legal victory, intended to prevent those impacts from worsening. In August 2023, a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/montana-climate-trial-young-activists-judge-order"&gt;ruled in favour&lt;/a&gt; of plaintiffs in Held v Montana, in which 16 young people accused the state of violating their constitutional rights by promoting planet-warming fossil fuels. The state’s supreme court affirmed the judge’s findings late last year, but plaintiffs say lawmakers have since passed new laws that violate that ruling. So last week, they &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/montana-climate-youth-activists-petition-law"&gt;filed a new petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on the supreme court to enforce their earlier win, one of several youth-led constitutional climate lawsuits filed in the US this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/13/a-shift-no-country-can-ignore-where-global-emissions-stand-10-years-after-the-paris-climate-agreement"&gt;‘A shift no country can ignore’: where global emissions stand, 10 years after the Paris climate agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/16/trauma-storm-hurricane-melissa-emotional-devastation-mental-health-ptsd-jamaica"&gt;The trauma after the storm: Hurricane Melissa leaves trail of emotional devastation across Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/10/synthetic-chemicals-food-system-health-burden-report"&gt;Synthetic chemicals in food system creating health burden of $2.2tn a year, report finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/montana-climate-youth-activists-petition-law"&gt;Montana youth activists who won landmark climate case push for court enforcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/trump-administration-fossil-fuels-climate"&gt;More than 40 Trump administration picks tied directly to oil, gas and coal, analysis shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/05/sunrise-movement-climate-activism-authoritarianism"&gt;Youth-led US climate activists widen focus to fight authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/18/as-the-us-invests-in-fossil-fuels-young-climate-activists-push-back-in-the-courts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ebde8f802264640a1fe0f7e6e0ee6622f28caae/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=571b5ae590b445833d815decdd4182e1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>UK borrowed more than expected in November amid pre-budget pressure</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/uk-government-borrowing-november-rachel-reeves-budget-economy</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/uk-government-borrowing-november-rachel-reeves-budget-economy</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 07:15:06 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;ONS figures show public sector net borrowing was £11.7bn – £1.9bn less than in same month last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK government borrowed more than expected in November, official figures show, amid pressure on the economy before chancellor Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net borrowing – the difference between spending and income – was £11.7bn last month, £1.9bn less than in the same month a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/uk-government-borrowing-november-rachel-reeves-budget-economy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621ea97f7087f9c8eba79a9ef19268192631b239/1113_0_3966_3173/master/3966.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e47d53f65c76132b50096ca069b5d7a3" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Reeves to Ryanair: Take the Guardian’s Christmas business quiz</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/reeves-to-ryanair-take-the-guardians-christmas-business-quiz</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/19/reeves-to-ryanair-take-the-guardians-christmas-business-quiz</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:00:56 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know your Tesla from your Jaguar?

Belgian prime minister &lt;strong&gt;Bart De Wever&lt;/strong&gt; said as the summit wrapped up that he believed “rationality has prevailed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;German chancellor Friedrich Merz had pushed hard for using Russia’s frozen assets but still said the final decision on the EU-backed loan “sends a clear signal&lt;/strong&gt;” to Vladimir Putin. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Ukraine would need to repay the loan only once Moscow paid for the damages it has caused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, agreed not to block&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the loan to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years&lt;/strong&gt; as long as his country, Slovakia and the Czech Republic were excluded from the guarantees for the debt. The deal would not affect the financial obligations of the three countries, which did not want to contribute to the financing of Ukraine, a text said on the agreement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy had urged EU leaders at the start of the summit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to use the frozen Russian assets&lt;/strong&gt;, saying: “It’s moral, it’s fair, it’s legal.” The EU estimates Ukraine needs an extra €135bn to stay afloat over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Washington, Donald Trump urged Ukraine to move swiftly on a peace deal ahead of fresh talks expected in Miami&lt;/strong&gt;. The US president told reporters in the Oval Office: “Well, they’re getting close to something, but I hope Ukraine moves quickly. I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there. And you know, every time they take too much time, then Russia changes their mind.” Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner plan to meet Russian officials in Florida this weekend, a White House official said, after the envoys held talks with a Ukrainian delegation in Berlin last Sunday and Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;With agencies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/19/ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-european-union-agreement-90bn-loan-deal-kyiv"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8493b00027ba31499f55a04e03aeea074669f5c/117_0_3463_2771/master/3463.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b8c3a7ad8498f151b2b3560db6919842" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Friday briefing: Why the search for Britain’s missing TV is running out of time</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/friday-briefing-why-the-search-for-britains-missing-tv-is-running-out-of-time</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/friday-briefing-why-the-search-for-britains-missing-tv-is-running-out-of-time</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:50:36 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: From Quatermass to Doctor Who, so much early television has vanished – and as film degrades and collectors age, the chances of recovering what remains are shrinking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. We take it for granted in 2025 that anything we watch on Christmas Day will soon be on a streaming platform, or end up on a pristine Blu-ray release. That was very much not the case in the early decades of British television. Programmes were often treated as fleeting stage productions rather than archival objects, and when recordings &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; made, tapes were often wiped or film reels junked, leaving frustrating gaps in our cultural memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I spent a day at Derby Quad which is devoted to Nigel Kneale’s pioneering Quatermass stories, and spoke to actor, writer and comedian &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toby Hadoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This newsletter is about the enduring appeal of seeking out these lost fragments in time, why certain programmes still cast such a long shadow, and why our chances of recovering missing episodes may now be running out. But first, here are the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| EU leaders have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/ukraine-deal-latest-europe-leaders-loan-zelenskyy"&gt;pledged a €90bn loan for Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; to meet urgent financial needs, but failed to agree on the preferred option for many of securing that loan against Russia’s frozen assets in the bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Boys as young as 11 who show &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/17/teachers-will-be-given-extra-training-to-tackle-misogyny-in-schools"&gt;misogynistic behaviour&lt;/a&gt; will be taught the difference between pornography and real relationships, as part of a multimillion pound investment to tackle misogyny in English schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The Bank of England has cut &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-375"&gt;interest rates to 3.75%,&lt;/a&gt; giving a pre-Christmas boost to the UK’s struggling economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US news &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Democrats have released &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-estate-files-photos"&gt;a new batch of photos&lt;/a&gt; from the estate of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, among them photographs of what appear to be lines from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sport &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| A full-throated “Rory roar” reverberated around MediaCity in Salford as Rory McIlroy became the first golfer in 36 years t&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/18/rory-mcilroy-bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-golf"&gt;o win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award&lt;/a&gt; – and tie a bow on a year for the ages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/friday-briefing-why-the-search-for-britains-missing-tv-is-running-out-of-time"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bf4a5fd3965b6a4abc3ce869b50d58191be0617/130_108_1301_1041/master/1301.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d8455c9664fc6da3f79dfd2a1d8a762d" medium="image"/></item><item><title>US strikes two more alleged drug boats, bringing death toll to over 100</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/us-venezuela-alleged-drug-boats-strikes-pacific-death-toll-increases</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/us-venezuela-alleged-drug-boats-strikes-pacific-death-toll-increases</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:38:23 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;US military declares five alleged drug traffickers killed in Pacific Ocean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US military said it killed on Thursday five more alleged drug traffickers aboard two vessels in the Pacific Ocean, bringing the divisive campaign’s death toll to over 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; has carried out such strikes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September but has provided no evidence that the boats are involved in drug trafficking, prompting debate about the operations’ legality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/us-venezuela-alleged-drug-boats-strikes-pacific-death-toll-increases"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58f6098a331f8b6ceaca62f7ec36e25b6eef133/209_559_790_632/master/790.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8710cdde9d43a315fb67af0b436daaf8" medium="image"/></item><item><title>UK’s largest proposed datacentre ‘understating planned water use’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/19/uk-largest-proposed-data-centre-planned-water-use-northumberland</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/19/uk-largest-proposed-data-centre-planned-water-use-northumberland</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:00:52 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Analysis suggests consumption at Northumberland site could be 50 times higher than US operator QTS estimates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK’s largest proposed datacentre is understating the scale of its planned water use, according to an analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first phase of construction for the hyperscale campus in Cambois in Northumberland has been given the go-ahead by the local council.

As I listened, it struck me that, while Europe’s role in the Middle East has been severely damaged by its immoral stance on the Gaza war and its self-inflicted exclusion from Iran nuclear diplomacy, Europeans still have a role to play when it comes to its neighbours in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe’s world has been turned upside down by Washington’s alignment with Moscow in the Ukraine war and the transatlantic rift as the Trump administration treats Europe as an adversary. Another dimension of this upheaval is Europe’s growing irrelevance in the Middle East. Only if Europeans accept that the past is behind them can they hope to regain a constructive independent role in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/19/europe-middle-east-syria-iraq-lebanon-donald-trump"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d890db46796f4dae286189a723f769ed4a603df/663_0_6380_5103/master/6380.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=dc8aa175b97d7a49ad8a5ae3e61496f2" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Thrillers should be on UK school curriculum to boost reading, says Lee Child</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/19/lee-child-thrillers-uk-school-curriculum-literacy</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/19/lee-child-thrillers-uk-school-curriculum-literacy</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:00:52 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author says focus on ‘masterpieces’ puts children off as he promotes prison literacy scheme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much of the literature taught in UK schools is putting children off reading and thrillers should become part of the curriculum, one of the world’s biggest selling authors has argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/07/jack-reacher-author-lee-child-more-sex-is-medically-implausible-and-im-as-rich-and-famous-as-i-need-to-be"&gt;Lee Child, the British writer of Jack Reacher novels&lt;/a&gt;, which have sold more than 100m copies worldwide, said: “I can totally understand why, if you’re an English teacher and you’ve read all your life and you love this stuff and you’ve been to university, then you want to introduce the big, major masterpieces.

Experts are raising the alarm on a complex crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the southern Peloponnese, the Greek fir is a towering presence. The deep green, slow-growing conifers have long defined the region’s high-altitude forests, thriving in the mountains and rocky soils. For generations they have been one of the country’s hardier species, unusually capable of withstanding drought, insects and the wildfires that periodically sweep through Mediterranean ecosystems. These Greek forests have lived with fire for as long as anyone can remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when Dimitrios Avtzis, a senior researcher at the Forest Research Institute (FRI) of Elgo-Dimitra, was dispatched to document the aftermath of a spring blaze in the region, nothing about the assignment seemed exceptional.

What we know on day 1,395&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hungary’s Viktor Orbán has agreed not to block&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/ukraine-deal-latest-europe-leaders-loan-zelenskyy"&gt;a massive EU-backed interest-free loan to Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years&lt;/strong&gt;, as long as his country, Slovakia and the Czech Republic were excluded from the guarantees for the debt. After failing to agree on using frozen Russian assets, diplomats announced the new loan in the early hours of Friday. The deal will not affect the financial obligations of Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which did not want to contribute to the financing of Ukraine, the text said. Moscow-friendly Hungary had previously said it would oppose the deal, just as it opposed the use of Russian assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Ukraine would have to repay the loan only if &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; paid reparations for its war&lt;/strong&gt;, and that the EU reserved the right to use Russian assets immobilised in the EU for repayment if Russia failed to pay compensation. Merz had pushed hard for the frozen asset plan – but still said the final decision on the loan “sends a clear signal” to Russian president Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The move follows hours of discussions among leaders on the technical details of a loan based on the frozen Russian assets, which turned out to be too complex or politically demanding to sort out at this stage&lt;/strong&gt;, diplomats said. “We have gone from saving Ukraine to saving face, at least that of those who have been pushing for the use of the frozen assets,” one EU diplomat said. The main difficulty in the use of the Russian money was providing Belgium, where €185bn ($217bn) of the total €210bn of Russian assets in Europe are held, with sufficient guarantees against financial and legal risks from potential Russian retaliation for the release of the money to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump has urged Ukraine to move “quickly” on a deal to end Russia’s invasion ahead of fresh talks expected in Miami at the weekend&lt;/strong&gt;. The US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday on a potential settlement: “Well, they’re getting close to something, but I hope Ukraine moves quickly. I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there. And you know, every time they take too much time, then Russia changes their mind.” Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner plan to meet Russian officials in Florida for the talks, a White House official said, after the envoys met a Ukrainian delegation in Berlin last Sunday and Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Danish government has accused Russia of being behind two “destructive and disruptive” cyber-attacks in what it describes as “very clear evidence” of a hybrid war,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/denmark-says-russia-was-behind-two-destructive-and-disruptive-cyber-attacks"&gt;reports Miranda Bryant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The Danish Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) announced on Thursday that Moscow was behind a cyber-attack on a Danish water utility in 2024 and a series of distributed denial-of-service attacks on Danish websites in the lead-up to municipal and regional council elections in November. A DDIS statement cited Russia’s “hybrid war against the west” and said: “The aim is to create insecurity in the targeted countries and to punish those that support Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian strikes near Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa on Thursday killed a woman in her car and hit infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; and the regional governor asked residents suffering long power cuts to stop blocking roads in protest. Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that a Russian drone killed a woman crossing a bridge in her car south-west of Odesa. Her three children were injured.

Big changes in policing and the courts are needed too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour set itself a mammoth task when it pledged, before last year’s election, to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/12/labour-strategy-tackling-violence-against-women-tories"&gt;halve violence against women and girls&lt;/a&gt; (VAWG) in 10 years. While many forms of crime have decreased over the past decade, sexual assault has not. In the year to March 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingjune2025#sexual-offences"&gt;1.9% of people&lt;/a&gt; in England and Wales experienced&amp;nbsp;it, and &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/sexualoffencesinenglandandwalesoverview/march2022"&gt;82%&lt;/a&gt; of victims were female. The&amp;nbsp;prevalence of image-related offences has risen sharply. So has concern about the impact on young men of violent pornography and influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this grim backdrop, and the fiscal constraints under which the government has chosen to operate, it is no wonder that the promised VAWG strategy was delayed. This is a societal issue that does&amp;nbsp;not sit neatly in one government department. Jess&amp;nbsp;Phillips is the minister responsible at the Home Office. But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/17/teachers-will-be-given-extra-training-to-tackle-misogyny-in-schools"&gt;education&amp;nbsp;and justice reforms&lt;/a&gt; are also essential if aims&amp;nbsp;are to be met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just when you thought BP was trying to generate less drama, the new chair has decided a new chief executive is needed. Say goodbye to Murray Auchincloss, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/26/bp-oil-and-gas-spending-green-energy-scale-back"&gt;who junked the green-ish transition strategy&lt;/a&gt; of his predecessor as recently as February. Meg O’Neill, the American boss of the Australian group Woodside Energy, becomes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive"&gt;BP’s first outside hire as chief executive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At face value, a new appointment should not be an outright surprise. Albert Manifold arrived as BP chair in July and, after the many flip-flops under &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/feb/11/time-for-bps-chair-to-head-for-the-exit"&gt;the ineffectual Helge Lund&lt;/a&gt;, he had a mandate to take his own view of how the company should be managed. If he and the board think an injection of “increased rigour and diligence” is necessary to fulfil the new oilier plan, fair enough. The activist investor Elliott may have been urging much the same. Even Auchincloss recognised the possibility he could be axed. His statement said he had told Manifold of his “openness to step down” if a new leader was identified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/dec/18/bp-opts-for-culture-shock-with-new-ceo-appointment-but-the-timing-is-odd"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d7cf0d1f17d8fc5ed8f0ef17c27ddea486b0397/677_0_3745_2995/master/3745.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=57817462515d2105e08e657951ef110a" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Democrats release new Epstein photos ahead of DoJ transparency deadline</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-estate-files-photos</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-estate-files-photos</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 18:11:03 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Images, undated and uncaptioned, include Vladimir Nabokov lines written on women and show Bill Gates and Noam Chomsky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/18/us-politics-live-venezuela-russia-strikes-trump-news-updates"&gt;US politics – live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-files-department-of-justice"&gt;What we know so far about the Epstein files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; on the House oversight committee have released a new batch of photos from the estate of convicted sex offender, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein"&gt;Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, as the deadline for the justice department to release its files related to Epstein looms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The images, released on Thursday, are undated and lack captions or context.

The problem is that its enemies will never see it that way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morally, the decision facing the European Council in Brussels this week has been a no-brainer. Russia invaded Ukraine illegally and unilaterally. Moscow shows no sign of wanting peace. It actively threatens other countries too, including Britain. Ukraine is running out of money. Yet &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/arguments-frozen-russian-assets-support-ukraine"&gt;£184bn worth&lt;/a&gt; of Russian assets &lt;a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/reparations-loan-where-russias-frozen-assets-are-held-across-the-eu/"&gt;remain frozen&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, notably in Belgium. That money should therefore be mobilised to fund Ukraine. To many, this would be the enactment of a&amp;nbsp;clear and present duty, proof positive that Europe can still be a heavy hitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the messy reaches of the real world, however, things have not been straightforward. Law, economics and politics all managed to insinuate themselves, sometimes venomously, into the intense buildup to Brussels. Reparations can have lethal political consequences. Seizure of assets will undoubtedly face&amp;nbsp;legal challenge. It is also bitterly opposed by Donald Trump, who wants the unfreezing of assets to form a key part of his pro-Russian peace plan. Mr&amp;nbsp;Trump is pressing hard for a quick deal, and US and&amp;nbsp;Russian negotiators are poised to meet again in Miami at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/18/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-and-ukraine-a-moment-of-truth-for-brussels-and-kyiv"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/694f03b6940776525c78ec0c161f667a272c0cbd/683_0_4050_3241/master/4050.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a326d85ac508babdec1d6fbf06f59e9b" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Money today or blood tomorrow’: EU leaders race to secure deal for Ukraine</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/eu-leaders-summit-funding-deal-for-ukraine</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/eu-leaders-summit-funding-deal-for-ukraine</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 17:38:51 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Summit divided on idea of loan secured against Russian assets, as Belgium seeks guarantees if scheme goes wrong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/belgian-politicians-finance-bosses-targeted-russian-intelligence-seized-assets"&gt;Belgian politicians and finance bosses targeted by Russian intelligence over seized assets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU leaders are racing to secure a funding deal for Ukraine that has been cast as a choice between “money today or blood tomorrow”, but Belgium continues to oppose a loan secured against Russia’s frozen assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a summit billed as make or break, EU leaders are discussing an unprecedented move to tap some of Russia’s €210bn sovereign assets frozen in the bloc days after the full-scale invasion of 2022.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/eu-leaders-summit-funding-deal-for-ukraine"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e606f8f96a99d4f1476eb390d790cf3f8593394/0_258_3941_3150/master/3941.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=16f8a05305aa6652b8ab996e3f4550b6" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Don’t weaken health and safety rules in the name of growth | Letter</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/18/dont-weaken-health-and-safety-rules-in-the-name-of-growth</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/18/dont-weaken-health-and-safety-rules-in-the-name-of-growth</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 17:09:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Wilkinson &lt;/strong&gt;says good regulation allows business to thrive without risking workers’ health &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Fingleton’s claim that health and safety rules are holding UK infrastructure back (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/12/health-and-safety-rules-holding-uk-infrastructure-back-says-writer-of-government-report"&gt;Report, 12&amp;nbsp;December&lt;/a&gt;) is not only wrong, it’s dangerous. Stripping back protections in the name of speed is a false economy that risks lives, reputations and resilience. The UK’s health and safety framework is the backbone of safe and sustainable growth. These regulations have driven a historic decline in workplace fatalities, injuries and ill health. Weakening them would reverse decades of progress and shift enormous costs on to the NHS, employers and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the progress, &lt;a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/fatals-overview.htm"&gt;124 people died&lt;/a&gt; in accidents at work in 2024-25. In 2023-24, the estimated annual cost of workplace injuries and new cases of work-related ill health reached £22.9bn. Good regulation allows businesses to thrive without compromising worker health and safety. The idea that deregulation will unlock growth ignores the reality – unsafe work slows projects, causes harm and damages reputations. We urge policymakers to reject calls for health and safety deregulation, and uphold the world-class standards that make Britain a safe, healthy and competitive place to work, trade and invest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Wilkinson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head of policy and public affairs, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institution of Occupational Safety and Health &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Surely, I don’t have to tell you that such quaint human emotions as “happiness” and “hope” are in short supply these days. This year, of all years, no one should be blamed for plugging their ears any time Mariah Carey comes on in the lobby of the unemployment office. And yet, we carry on with the rituals of joy that seem more and more incongruous, when life feels like some never-ending episode of MTV’s Ridiculousness, where God comments on clips of the human race getting hit in the face with a plastic baseball bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m certainly making an effort to put on a pleasant facade.

Last month, Congress passed the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text"&gt;Epstein Files Transparency Act&lt;/a&gt;, which required the release of those materials by 19 December, except in narrow cases where they would jeopardize current investigations, harm national security or foreign policy goals, or reveal information about Epstein’s victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Trump signed the legislation, his administration has been silent on its progress. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers asked Pam Bondi, the attorney general, for a briefing on the department of justice’s progress, but she did not provide one. Two Democratic senators among that group &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/democrats-epstein-files-pam-bondi"&gt;subsequently pledged&lt;/a&gt; to block some civilian nominees, because they were concerned the administration “is gearing up to disregard the law we led the fight in the Senate to pass, which overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/jeffrey-epstein-files-department-of-justice"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2b8259535177027e87a39e06f382f8a98cafeac/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fdf71cd367ab6c6c8cdfda413d4d44fa" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Bank of England cuts interest rates to 3.75% in pre-Christmas boost for struggling economy</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-375</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-375</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 12:00:49 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Rate-setters back quarter-point cut after steep fall in inflation and weak economic data but vote remained close&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-interest-rates-cut-inflation-economy-stock-markets-business-live-news-updates"&gt;Business live – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England has cut interest rates by a quarter point, delivering a pre-Christmas boost to the struggling UK economy, but a split vote among its rate-setters pointed to continued concerns about inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) opted by five votes to four to reduce its key base rate from 4% to 3.75%, signalling that it now expects inflation to be “closer” to the 2% target in the first quarter of the new year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/18/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-375"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993b1fe216a5defc979f654013b754ec0067cb1a/428_0_4267_3415/master/4267.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=4ce56ca96df3fdb5ce162f51b0ef4c6b" medium="image"/></item><item><title>UN distances itself from International Women’s Day website winning corporate partnerships</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/international-womens-day-website-owned-london-pr-firm-not-linked-to-un</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/international-womens-day-website-owned-london-pr-firm-not-linked-to-un</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 12:45:41 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Sainsbury’s, Barclays and University College London have all drawn on themes created by IWD site run by London business with no link to UN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody owns &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/international-womens-day"&gt;International Women’s Day&lt;/a&gt;, but if you asked the 193 countries, countless businesses and NGOs that mark it each year, they would probably agree it has been popularised, defined and formalised by the &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of the website “internationalwomensday.com”, a London-based marketing firm, disagrees.

His famous fake tan is a bit more sallow than usual and seems painted on more thickly and clumsily than it was before. He appears to nod off in front of cameras more and more often, including in cabinet meetings and press events in the Oval Office. His public schedule &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/us/politics/trump-age-health.html"&gt;is light&lt;/a&gt;: he is often at his golf clubs, has traveled around the country less frequently than at this point in his first term, and now only rarely holds the stadium rallies that once defined his preferred style of politics. He tends to sit, even when others are standing, and has shortened his daily schedule, often not conducting official duties before noon. A New York Times report found that his public appearances have declined by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/us/politics/trump-age-health.html"&gt;nearly 40%&lt;/a&gt; compared to his first year in office. He sometimes disappears from public view for days as he did in the late summer, and he and his administration have released unclear and conflicting information about his health. His right hand seems to be experiencing frequent injury or discoloration – it will often be covered with a band-aid or smeared with makeup; the White House has claimed, implausibly, that he is bruised from shaking too many hands.

The government is finally publishing its violence against women and girls (VAWG) strategy. In its manifesto Labour said it wanted to halve VAWG within a decade, and so this is a vital policy area. Publication of the strategy has been delayed three times. In the Commons on Monday, in response to an urgent question on this, Jess Phillips, minister for safeguarding and VAWG, said the delays were down to her. “It is entirely my fault because, with every iteration, the strategy was not ambitious enough. I could have done it more quickly, and then it would not have been as good,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the document is being published today, the VAWG strategy is being promoted via a budget-style, week-long media strategy. We have already had announcements form the Home Office covering &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/over-1-billion-for-victims-of-domestic-abuse-to-access-support-and-rebuild-their-lives"&gt;extra spending for abuse victims&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/abuse-victims-to-get-specialist-nhs-support"&gt;specialist NHS help for abuse victims&lt;/a&gt;, and all police forces introducing &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-vawg-strategy-will-leave-offenders-with-nowhere-to-hide"&gt;specialist rape and sexual offence teams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit sick, I have to say, as somebody who’s campaigned on this for many years, of just trying to put nicer plasters onto ever growing scars, and so we’ve got to – the government is really, really focused on the prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the success of this strategy hinges on whether delivery partners are equipped to succeed. Early indications around funding are deeply concerning. The strategy introduces welcome measures in schools and the NHS which will, by design, drive up disclosures and referrals to police and victim services. Yet frontline services are already overstretched and struggling to meet need, and the criminal justice system remains in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding is critical. Driving up demand without increasing capacity puts victims at risk and threatens to destabilise the very partners the strategy relies upon. This concern is heightened by the lack of meaningful consultation. Victim services are not an optional extra to this strategy - they must be the backbone of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/dec/18/violence-women-girls-strategy-labour-conservatives-badenoch-starmer-latest-news-updates"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85aac2387882f9da78e012c3a70388532b91d2c4/715_0_4467_3574/master/4467.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=dd593dfdf9920e887a26bf9402460627" medium="image"/></item><item><title>French court finds ‘twisted’ anaesthetist guilty of killing 12 patients</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/french-court-finds-twisted-anaesthetist-frederic-pechier-guilty-killing-12-patients</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/french-court-finds-twisted-anaesthetist-frederic-pechier-guilty-killing-12-patients</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 09:44:54 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Former top medic described as ‘Dr Death’ by prosecutors poisoned 30 people ranging in age from four to 89&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/08/france-anaesthetist-frederic-pechier-trial-accused-of-intentionally-poisoning-patients"&gt;French anaesthetist&lt;/a&gt; described by prosecutors as “Dr Death” has been found guilty of intentionally poisoning 30 patients and killing 12 over almost a decade as a top medic in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frédéric Péchier, 53, once seen by colleagues as a “star anaesthetist”, was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday after state prosecutors said he was “one of the biggest criminals in the history of the French legal system”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/french-court-finds-twisted-anaesthetist-frederic-pechier-guilty-killing-12-patients"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2e06ced3c2138c88f3ded576db167ad8435b1ce/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=452f1d45da0f254e92320f85a987ac8e" medium="image"/></item><item><title>How many big names have paid the price for being linked to Jeffrey Epstein?

That says as much as the scandal itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, the annual DealBook Summit got under way in New York. It’s a series of public talks billed as conversations with “the world’s most consequential people”, and is part of that circuit of live events in which the worst people on Earth gather on stage to address the second-worst people on Earth, their paying audience. Hosted by Andrew Ross Sorkin, the conference was a characteristically starry affair, but in a lineup that included Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and “changemaker” Halle Berry, it was Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel and a former associate of Jeffrey Epstein, who really caught the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first thought about Barak’s appearance was: Larry Summers must be spitting. Summers, the former president of Harvard and another &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/19/larry-summers-harvard-epstein"&gt;Epstein associate&lt;/a&gt;, was very much not on stage at the DealBook Summit, nor is he anywhere else in polite society right now. One can only imagine how bitter he must be feeling about the variance in fortunes of the men – and occasional woman – with known connections to Epstein. Of this list, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/books/review/virginia-roberts-giuffre-nobodys-girl-memoir.html"&gt;two are dead&lt;/a&gt; (Marvin Minsky and Jean-Luc Brunel), one is in jail (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell"&gt;Ghislaine Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;) and one has lost his house, his title and his invitation to the family Christmas (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/15/former-prince-andrew-is-butt-of-the-years-best-christmas-cracker-joke"&gt;Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor&lt;/a&gt;). But for the rest of the prominent associates, email correspondents, birthday-card signatories, grant recipients and dinner companions of the late convicted paedophile – all of whom insist that, while in Epstein’s orbit, they remained in total ignorance as to the man’s true nature – the cancellation fairy’s aim has been predictably inconsistent and wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Richard Pearson is visiting Surrey to close down his late father’s home and settle his affairs and, everywhere he looks, the flag of St George is flying “from suburban gardens and filling stations and branch post offices”. How nice, he thinks, how festive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Soon he learns the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So runs the opening not of a recent piece of journalism, but a novel by JG Ballard, Kingdom Come, which despite being almost 20 years old anticipates today’s Britain with eerie precision. In the mid-2000s, Pearson reads up on his new surroundings, only to find the same headlines that assail us in the mid-2020s: “Every day the local newspaper reported attacks on an asylum hotel, the torching of a Bangladeshi takeaway, injuries to a Kosovan youth thrown over the fence into an industrial estate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/18/sickness-britain-novel-20-years-ago-jg-ballard"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1d5476829d563e1c79c77722404b7e709b1e0ab/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e711cddefc5c2e3266bd17e1a00979ad" medium="image"/></item><item><title>BP names Meg O’Neill as new CEO after incumbent ousted</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 08:18:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;O’Neill, who has led Woodside Energy since 2021, will be oil and gas company’s first female chief executive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP’s board has appointed its first female chief executive in a move to revive the oil company’s fortunes, after ousting Murray Auchincloss less than two years into his role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unexpected leadership shake-up, Auchincloss will step down as chief executive with immediate effect, but remain in an advisory role until the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1b93a106ace7dffe831d6e1a99a5ae738516dc/424_0_3675_2940/master/3675.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c2924ca9426ceade759dc923ed5a2d85" medium="image"/></item><item><title>EU told to choose between ‘money today or blood tomorrow’ as leaders debate giving Russian assets to Ukraine – Europe live</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/18/eu-frozen-russian-assets-ukraine-war-europe-latest-news-updates</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/18/eu-frozen-russian-assets-ukraine-war-europe-latest-news-updates</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 08:30:43 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;European leaders meet in Brussels as Poland’s Donald Tusk issues warning to fellow EU states&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief opponent of sending any further money to Ukraine, Hungary’s &lt;strong&gt;Viktor Orbán, &lt;/strong&gt;just told reporters in Brussels that the idea of using frozen Russian assets was “stupid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;The whole idea is stupid&lt;/strong&gt;. … There are two countries which are at war – it’s not European Union, [it’s] Russia and Ukraine – and the European Union would like to take away the money of one of the warring party and then to give it to another one. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s marching into the war.

That’s where leadership comes in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you listen to a Christmas performance of Handel’s Messiah, it is easy to persuade yourself that all is still well with music and the arts in Britain. I again felt the familiar potency of both Messiah and of music more widely in London’s St Martin’s-in-the-Fields on Tuesday this week. When the musicians and singers launched into the fabulously affirmative final chorus, Worthy is the Lamb, towards which Handel and his librettist Charles Jennens have all along been building, the annual ritual poured forth Messiah’s deep sense of shared security and allayed doubt afresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been going to Messiah at Christmas for decades now, at one venue or another, and the experience never ceases to lift the spirits in this darkest of seasons. This year, though, more disturbing feelings were also in play. The tender balm of Messiah’s opening lines for the tenor – “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people” – has rarely sounded more necessary and consolatory than it did this week.

While the Greek word &lt;em&gt;krisis&lt;/em&gt; refers to an exceptional moment that disrupts the normal order of things, since 2015 it has become an &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02637758231152478"&gt;enduring condition&lt;/a&gt; in contemporary Europe. That year, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35158769"&gt;1 million people&lt;/a&gt; sought refuge in Europe, fleeing wars and persecution. In the ensuing decade, the issue of migration has been so thoroughly weaponised that one can hardly remember a time when it was not considered &lt;a href="https://portolan-journal.org/?post=punitive-environments-and-the-antiimmigration-authoritarian-commonsense"&gt;a crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of a permanent state of emergency does not reflect a reality whereby Europe genuinely cannot cope with new arrivals.

It was July and Wimbledon had started. “He said: ‘We want you to go down and get into the women’s changing rooms and report on lesbian behaviour.’ One didn’t normally swear at that time but I declined. That was the attitude then,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the late 1960s until the early 70s, Brayfield was one of a small group of female journalists working on women’s pages in newspapers. “We were dealing with everyday sexism on an unbelievable scale,” she said. “You learned to wear trousers or take the lift because if you took the stairs someone would try to look up your skirt. But then you couldn’t go to a lot of press conference venues in trousers. In the Savoy, for example, women in trousers weren’t allowed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/pretty-birds-and-silly-moos-the-women-behind-the-sex-discrimination-act"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24e4e7b1ccd469d5e45ba6ee35d068075ce29dfd/484_0_4349_3480/master/4349.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5a2e3c538b4f35fcd0f45d178d0d8240" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘It’s an open invasion’: how millions of quagga mussels changed Lake Geneva for ever</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/18/invasive-quagga-mussels-lake-geneva-aoe</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/18/invasive-quagga-mussels-lake-geneva-aoe</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 05:00:29 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The molluscs are decimating food chains in Switzerland, have devastated the Great Lakes in the US, and this week were spotted in Northern Ireland for the first time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like cholesterol clogging up an artery, it took just a couple of years for the quagga mussels to infiltrate the 5km (3-mile) highway of pipes under the Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne (EPFL). By the time anyone realised what was going on, it was too late. The power of some heat exchangers had dropped by a third, blocked with ground-up shells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air conditioning faltered, and buildings that should have been less than 24C in the summer heat couldn’t get below 26 to 27C. The invasive mollusc had infiltrated pipes that suck cold water from a depth of 75 metres (250ft) in Lake Geneva to cool buildings. “It’s an open invasion,” says Mathurin Dupanier, utilities operations manager at EPFL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathurin Dupanier indicates the water cooling systems that were blocked by the invasive quagga mussels.

What we know on day 1,394&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian forces have struck a tanker in a southern Russian port and caused deaths,&lt;/strong&gt; the regional governor said early on Thursday. The strike in the southern Russian port of Rostov-on-Don damaged the vessel and, according to preliminary information, crew members had died, regional governor Yuri Slyusar said on Telegram. Mayor Alexander Skriabin was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying: “Emergency teams are extinguishing the fire on the tanker that was struck while docked in a drone attack … A leak of oil products was avoided. Unfortunately, there are dead and injured.” Slyusar also said parts of a high-rise apartment block under construction were damaged in the city and two private homes burned in a nearby town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian air strikes on and around the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/east-of-zaporizhzhia-ukraines-drone-crews-face-endless-battle-to-hold-the-line"&gt;Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/east-of-zaporizhzhia-ukraines-drone-crews-face-endless-battle-to-hold-the-line"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wounded at least 32&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt;, local authorities said. All the wounded came from the city and its surroundings, the head of the regional military administration, Ivan Fedorov, said on Telegram. Rescue services earlier said five children were among the casualties in a provisional toll of 30 after the Russian strikes on a block of flats, a house and an educational establishment on Wednesday. Firefighters were seen battling a blaze in a multi-storey housing block. Fedorov said two people were also wounded in a Russian drone strike on a civilian car in Kushuhum, south of Zaporizhzhia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be in Brussels on Thursday to convince European partners to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, despite Washington “pressuring” EU countries against the plan&lt;/strong&gt;, Agence France-Presse quoted an unnamed Ukrainian official as saying. The European Union has laid out a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/arguments-frozen-russian-assets-support-ukraine"&gt;plan to use the frozen assets&lt;/a&gt; to harness €90bn ($105bn) for a loan to help Ukraine repel Moscow’s forces, with the money to be paid back by any eventual Russian reparations to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belgian politicians and senior finance executives have been subject to a campaign of intimidation orchestrated by Russian intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; aimed at persuading the country to block the use of €185bn ($217bn) assets for Ukraine, according to European intelligence agencies. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/belgian-politicians-finance-bosses-targeted-russian-intelligence-seized-assets"&gt;Dan Sabbagh and Jennifer Rankin report&lt;/a&gt; that security officials indicated to the Guardian that there had been deliberate targeting of key figures at Euroclear, the securities depository holding the majority of Russia’s frozen assets, and leaders of the country. EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday are debating whether to approve the lending of urgently needed funds for Ukraine secured on Russian central bank assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was preparing to wage a new “year of war” on his country in 2026&lt;/strong&gt;, after Vladimir Putin said Moscow would “certainly” achieve its objectives. “Today, we heard yet another signal from Moscow that they are preparing to make next year a year of war,” the Ukrainian president said in his evening address on Wednesday. The statement was a reaction to the Russian president, who earlier said Moscow would “certainly” achieve its goals in its Ukraine offensive, including seizing Ukrainian territories it claims as its own, amid the flurry of international diplomacy to end the war. Putin warned that Moscow would seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its allies rejected the Kremlin’s demands in peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK has given its final warning to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/roman-abramovich"&gt;Roman Abramovich&lt;/a&gt; to release £2.5bn ($3.3bn) from the oligarch’s sale of Chelsea FC to give to Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, telling the billionaire to release the funds within 90 days or face court action, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/uk-will-transfer-abramovich-cash-from-sale-of-chelsea-to-ukraine-fund-starmer-says"&gt;reports Jessica Elgot&lt;/a&gt;.

Government regulation can change the terms of debate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 10 December, the world watched as Australia enacted the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/09/australia-under-16-social-media-ban-begins-apps-listed"&gt;first social media ban for under-16s&lt;/a&gt;. Whether it will have the desired effect of improving young people’s lives we are yet to find out. But what the ban has achieved already is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many politicians, along with academics and philosophers, have noted that self-regulation has not been an effective safeguard against the harms of social media – especially when the bottom line for people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk depends on keeping eyes on screens. For too long, these companies resisted, decrying censorship and prioritising “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/07/meta-facebook-instagram-threads-mark-zuckerberg-remove-fact-checkers-recommend-political-content"&gt;free speech&lt;/a&gt;” over moderation. The Australian government decided waiting was no longer an option. The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;social media ban and similar regulation across the world is now dragging tech companies kicking and screaming toward change. That it has taken the force of the law to ensure basic standards – such as robust age verification, teen-friendly user accounts and deactivation where appropriate – are met shows the moral argument alone was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The investigation’s apparent focus is to identify ways to criminally charge ex-FBI and intelligence officials who have already been investigated and effectively exonerated by two special counsels and a Republican-led Senate panel, which mounted exhaustive inquiries into Russia’s efforts to boost Trump in 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/17/trump-us-attorney-investigation-intelligence-officials"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cee52d8f37d57fc2b5a0c95040de1cf4a64dfb18/633_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c1c9718e975b3b04f68a0d2c440c9c23" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The chaotic life of an immigration lawyer in Trump’s America: ‘Some days you break down in tears’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/17/immigration-lawyer-trump</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/17/immigration-lawyer-trump</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:00:07 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The Guardian followed immigration attorney Milli Atkinson as she pivoted from case to case – and tried to keep herself sane.

At least 88 asylum seekers have been arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at their court hearings.

She leads the San Francisco Bar Association’s Attorney of the Day program, which provides people from all over Northern California with free legal advice when they show up to immigration court.

announcing that one of the country’s most experienced and accomplished public health leaders, Dr Mary T Bassett, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/12/us/harvard-replaces-public-health-center-director.html"&gt;would “step down”&lt;/a&gt; as director of the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights. The email struck a polite, bureaucratic tone, thanking her for her service and offering an upbeat rationale for a new “focus on children’s health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It omitted the fact that, &lt;a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/12/10/fxb-center-director/"&gt;according to a Harvard Crimson source&lt;/a&gt;, Bassett had been asked to resign just two hours earlier and instructed to vacate her office by the end of the year. The decision was not a routine administrative transition. It was the culmination of a year of escalating pressure on the Center for Health and Human Rights for its work on the health and human rights of Palestinians. Powerful figures inside and outside Harvard, including the former Harvard president and &lt;a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/11/17/summers-epstein-wing-man-woman-described-as-mentee/"&gt;now thoroughly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/12/3/aea-summers-ban/"&gt;disgraced&lt;/a&gt; economist Larry Summers, &lt;a href="https://x.com/LHSummers/status/1981131402583183400"&gt;condemned this work and claimed&lt;/a&gt; it “foments antisemitism”. A leading public health scholar whose career has been defined by work on racial justice, poverty, HIV, and global inequality appears to have been removed not because her commitments shifted, but because the political costs of applying those commitments to Palestinians became too great for Harvard to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/17/harvard-palestine-mary-bassett-global-health"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd1bcd8903b3729d5e757d57d112428853c907a/317_0_3173_2538/master/3173.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=579f4e8f2c594b8ed7d7ec628e43f7c5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>AI toys are suddenly everywhere - but I suggest you don't give them to your children | Arwa Mahdawi</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/17/ai-toys-suddenly-everywhere-dont-give-them-to-your-children</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/17/ai-toys-suddenly-everywhere-dont-give-them-to-your-children</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:00:32 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year my four-year-old tried out an AI soft toy for a few days.

With the likes of Mattel, which owns the Barbie brand, &lt;a href="https://corporate.mattel.com/news/mattel-and-openai-announce-strategic-collaboration"&gt;announcing a “strategic collaboration”&lt;/a&gt; with OpenAI, you can bet more of the uncanny objects will be in a department store near you soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me offer myself up as a cautionary tale for anyone who might be intrigued by the idea of a cuddly chatbot.

I’ve now read their “what we do” section four or five times, and I have a problem – I can’t figure out what they do. There are two possibilities here. One: they don’t know what they do. Two: what they do is so pointless and embarrassing that they dare not spell it out in plain English. “We forge marketing systems at the forefront of the online wellness space” translates to something like “we use ChatGPT to sell dodgy supplements”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But understanding what so many businesses actually &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;is the least of my worries. I’m currently among the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxrp7znkdlo"&gt;5% of Brits&lt;/a&gt; who are unemployed. In my six months of job hunting, my total lack of success has begun to make me question my own existence. Just like when you repeat a word over and over until it loses all meaning, when you apply repeatedly for jobs in a similar field, the semantics of the entire situation begin to fall apart like a snotty tissue. About one in five of my job applications elicit a rejection email, usually bemoaning the sheer number of “quality applicants” for the position. For the most part, though – nothing. It’s almost like the job never existed in the first place, and it’s possible that it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and Diva&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/17/ghost-jobs-robot-gatekeepers-ai-interview-job-hunting"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f51c8b92b57fa0ed70a5ee9bae86dbdfc80ddb7/403_141_2992_2394/master/2992.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=065b5db1f4ad97a95fe97a4335e2c640" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Police investigate after white-tailed eagles go missing across UK</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/17/police-investigate-after-white-tailed-eagles-go-missing-across-uk</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/17/police-investigate-after-white-tailed-eagles-go-missing-across-uk</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:12:55 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Conservationists appeal to public for help after rare birds disappear in suspicious circumstances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first white-tailed eagles to fledge in England for hundreds of years has vanished in suspicious circumstances, alongside two more “devastating” disappearances of the reintroduced raptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are appealing for public help as they investigate the disappearances, which is a setback to the bird’s successful reintroduction.

Keir Starmer, the actual, nonfictional UK prime minister, needs to channel the one played by Hugh Grant – and stand up to an absurd US president &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/dec/16/bbc-bosses-right-to-stick-by-their-guns-against-trump-says-minister"&gt;now bullying the BBC with a $10bn lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just imagine for one moment that Starmer decided to make Donald Trump’s claim against the BBC the final straw for a special relationship that is increasingly special only in a bad way. That would not be outlandish, for not only has Trump taken aim against a British broadcaster, but earlier this week it seemed that his &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79x54dprngo"&gt;promise of an AI “prosperity deal”&lt;/a&gt; (bought, let’s not forget, with gurning invites to Windsor Castle) is set to evaporate.

As Pippa Crerar revealed for the Guardian yesterday, the government will today announce that the UK is rejoining the EU’s Erasmus student exchange programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move has been welcomed by pro-EU parties. The Liberal Democrats released this comment from their universities spokesperson, &lt;strong&gt;Ian Sollom&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of campaigning by the Liberal Democrats, we welcome the news that the UK is finally set to rejoin the vital Erasmus+ student exchange scheme from 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a moment of real opportunity and a clear step towards repairing the disastrous Conservative Brexit deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotland did not vote for Brexit. Our young people, our universities, and our communities have already been paying the price of Farage’s campaign to leave for years while Starmer refuses to admit that the whole thing was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 The SNP has campaigned tirelessly for Scotland’s access to Erasmus, while Labour and the Tories ignored the voices of the young people most affected by Brexit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 It is baffling how Labour is only now realising what Scots figured out a long time ago. This isn’t leadership, it’s a desperate scramble to fix a mess they helped create.

But the nectar is laced with a toxic nerve agent called isoshinanolone, which strikes at the ant’s nervous system, leaving it with sluggish movements, weakened muscles, and causing it to groom itself excessively. Eventually the prey falls upside down in spasms, with the nerve agent sometimes killing it outright. But apart from isoshinanolone, the nectar also contains three types of sugars that can all absorb water and make the rim of the pitcher especially slippery, so the prey is more likely to slide down into the pitchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/17/plantwatch-pitcher-plant-sweet-nectar-laced-toxic-nerve-agent"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03d9a2ee013cb873418fb6da851e6c53d91a3dcb/1767_513_4674_3739/master/4674.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=28e8ff8ee37ce04e1e6524051232000f" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Putin thinks democracy is the west’s weakness.

What we know on day 1,393&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under post-ceasefire guarantees provided by the United States and Europe to Ukraine, peacekeepers could in certain circumstances repel Russian forces&lt;/strong&gt;, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told ZDF public television in an interview, adding that this remained a far-off prospect. Pressed by interviewers for details on the possible security guarantees floated by the United States in Monday’s Berlin talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Merz said the guarantors would need to repel Russian forces should there be a violation of any ceasefire terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We would secure a demilitarized zone between the warring parties and, to be very specific, we would also act against corresponding Russian incursions and attacks.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We’re not there yet,” he said.&lt;/strong&gt; “The fact that the Americans have made such a commitment – to protect Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire as if it were Nato territory – I think that’s a remarkable new position for the United States of America,” Merz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelenskyy has said proposals negotiated with US officials on a peace deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/ukraine-russia-peace-plans-zelenskyy-berlin-talks-putin"&gt;could be soon finalised&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; after which American envoys will present them to the Kremlin. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/ukraine-talks-european-leaders-meet-berlin-starmer-macron-zelenskyy-merz-us-witkoff"&gt;After two days of talks in Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, US officials said on Monday they had resolved “90%” of the problematic issues between Russia and Ukraine, but despite the positive spin it is not clear that an end to the war is any closer, particularly as the Russian side is absent from the current talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson indicated that the Kremlin opposes European participation in talks on ending the conflict&lt;/strong&gt; in Ukraine based on a US plan. “The participation of the Europeans, in terms of acceptability, does not bode well,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. Peskov also said that the Kremlin had not yet been informed of the results of the latest talks in Berlin on Monday between Zelenskyy and European leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UN rights chief voiced alarm Wednesday over diminishing freedoms in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory&lt;/strong&gt;, saying restrictions were tightening on freedom of movement, expression and religion. Volker Turk painted a grim picture of events in a presentation to the UN Human Rights Council, the United Nations’ top rights body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian authorities on Tuesday named German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle as an “undesirable organization,”&lt;/strong&gt; effectively outlawing its operation in the country. Under Russian law, involvement with an “undesirable organization,” including sharing its content, is a criminal offence. In a statement, Deutsche Welle director general Barbara Massing called the designation Russia’s latest attempt to silence independent media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is now receiving electricity through only one of two external power lines&lt;/strong&gt;, its Russian management said on Tuesday.

Sore teeth and gums are debilitating, and dentistry ought not to be out of reach for anyone who needs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to prioritise complex cases, as well as the lack of urgent care in some places, has been taken following a consultation that highlighted these two issues.

Donald Trump’s decision to follow through on threats to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/trump-bbc-lawsuit"&gt;sue&lt;/a&gt; over the content of a Panorama programme broadcast in October 2024 may not have come as a surprise, given Mr Trump’s litigious record in the United States. But it will add to the general air of beleaguerment at the corporation and further embolden its domestic political enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A terse BBC &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/dec/16/bbc-bosses-right-to-stick-by-their-guns-against-trump-says-minister"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday suggested that there would be no backing down in the face of White House bullying. That is the right response to absurd claims of “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” caused to the US president, and a fantastical request for damages amounting to $10bn. The BBC has rightly &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c874nw4g2zzo"&gt;apologised&lt;/a&gt; for the misleading splicing together of separate clips from Mr Trump’s rabble-rousing speech on January 6 2020, prior to the violent storming of the US Capitol. A serious error of judgment was made in that editing process – though the House of Representatives January 6 committee concluded that Trump did &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/18/jan6-committee-deliver-judgment-trump-00074365"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt; his speech to incite an insurrection.

On a cloudy November day in 2022, her mother, Julie Newman, was about to complete her final round of radiation, after being diagnosed with breast cancer in September. The whole family, a close-knit bunch, was gathering with balloons and signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Freed, then a few weeks shy of her 31st birthday, was carrying a secret. Spurred by her mother’s diagnosis, she had her first mammogram a couple days earlier, and it had turned up a suspicious spot. Now she needed a second, diagnostic mammogram, and likely a biopsy. She found herself walking a surreal sort of tightrope, caught between relief that her mother’s treatment was over and fear that she might soon be starting her own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/ng-interactive/2025/dec/16/breast-cancer-mother-daughter"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9084d7c592a438f2aea5036dcdd7799fa97af2a/0_462_3600_2879/master/3600.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=dd86ff77efad670f45ed8727443a69b9" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Arctic endured year of record heat as climate scientists warn of ‘winter being redefined’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/artic-record-heat-shrunken-sea-ice-report</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/artic-record-heat-shrunken-sea-ice-report</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:01:09 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Region known as ‘world’s refrigerator’ is heating up as much as four times as quickly as global average, Noaa experts say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arctic endured a year of record heat and shrunken sea ice as the world’s northern latitudes continue a rapid shift to becoming rainier and less ice-bound due to the climate crisis, scientists have reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From October 2024 to September 2025, temperatures across the entire Arctic region were the hottest in 125 years of modern record keeping, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said, with the last 10 years being the 10 warmest on record in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/artic-record-heat-shrunken-sea-ice-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4ae05119633c8f379420dd748587f7dbf75955e/368_0_3664_2933/master/3664.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=23d2225b71cd3b0f30e3f8d7618ce6cb" medium="image"/></item><item><title>LA investigators expected to lay out case against Rob Reiner’s son Nick</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/rob-reiner-nick-parents-murder-charge</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/rob-reiner-nick-parents-murder-charge</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:02:47 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;District attorney’s office has until Wednesday to file charges against Nick Reiner following deaths of his parents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles investigators are expected on Tuesday to lay out their case against Nick Reiner, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/15/rob-nick-reiner-arrest"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of murdering his parents, the actor-director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detectives from the Los Angeles police department’s (LAPD) homicide division took Nick, 32, into custody on Sunday night, hours after his parents were found dead in their Brentwood home, the department &lt;a href="https://x.com/LAPDPIO/status/2000652916026421685/photo/1"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/rob-reiner-nick-parents-murder-charge"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1582ee3750d9bdc37bda4367558e54d6ef11a8a/784_0_4447_3558/master/4447.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2d12ac41f047e7395305408402a9b2de" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Source of pride for Syria’: man who disarmed Bondi shooter lauded in home town</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/syria-ahmed-al-ahmed-who-disarmed-bondi-shooter-lauded-in-home-town</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/syria-ahmed-al-ahmed-who-disarmed-bondi-shooter-lauded-in-home-town</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:10:09 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;News of Ahmed al-Ahmed’s selfless act quickly reached al-Nayrab, where locals say it proves religion or birthplace no barrier to heroism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man who risked his life to wrestle a gun from a shooter in the Bondi beach terror attack on Sunday has become a hero in his home town in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video of Ahmed al-Ahmed’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/15/man-who-tackled-alleged-bondi-gunman-couldnt-bear-to-see-people-dying-cousin-says-ntwnfb"&gt;selfless act&lt;/a&gt; quickly reached his birthplace of al-Nayrab, a small town in the countryside of Idlib, north-west Syria.

To most conservatives, particularly US Republicans, legalising weed was as realistic as nuclear disarmament, or abolishing national borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of the phrase “war on drugs” and the first people that probably come to mind are Republican presidents Nixon, Reagan and George HW and George W Bush. Although the clampdown reached its harshest levels during the presidency of Mr “I didn’t inhale” Bill Clinton, it always seemed as if the GOP owned the position of being “tough on drugs”. As recently as 2023, Mitch McConnell, then Senate Republican leader, reaffirmed this reputation &lt;a href="https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/remarks/americans-want-law-and-order-democrats-want-leniency"&gt;by stating&lt;/a&gt; that: “Democrats are struggling with the basics.

In many ways it worked – there was confusion, anger and exhaustion as organisations scrambled to fill the gap left by the USAID freeze.

Only a model that gives them hope will halt the populists &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much does Europe’s future resemble its gruesome past? That question was already pressing before Donald Trump retook the White House, and turned support for the European far-right “patriotic” parties into US policy. That is, of course, what his newly published National Security Strategy means, committing the US to “cultivating resistance” in European nations against the supposed “civilisational erasure” represented by immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With or without US interference, far-right authoritarianism is now an entirely plausible European future, unless there is drastic change. After all, it is already the US’s present reality. American exceptionalism once held that such an outcome was impossible in the world’s oldest continuous constitutional republic, with its system of separation of powers and no history of despotism.

Ministers are due to publish today a green paper on BBC charter renewal, setting out plans for how the corporation will be funded into the 2030s. With fewer and fewer people watching free-to-air TV, the licence fee is getting harder to justify, but there is no consensus as to what should replace it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, within the BBC at least, there probably is a consensus that the last thing licence fee payers want to see their money spent on is a multimillion-pound compensation payment to Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative party leader and member of parliament Kemi Badenoch said that the distortion of the speech by the Panorama documentary was “absolutely shocking,” adding: “That is fake news, actually putting different things together to make something look different from what it actually was.” She continued: “And I do think heads should roll.

Perhaps it is time to let our guard down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early autumn, over pizza and wine, I had a conversation with a dear friend. He’s Turkish. We were in Ayvalık, a small town on Turkey’s Aegean coast, talking about cultural imprints, when he suddenly paused and looked at me. “You know what?” he said. “Whenever I ask you how you are, you never really answer. You go into a meta space immediately – talking about politics or about bigger things that worry you – but you never say how you actually are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about his observation ever since, debating in my mind whether it was true – and I’ve recently reached the conclusion that, unfortunately, he was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carolin Würfel is a writer, screenwriter and journalist who lives in Berlin and Istanbul.

As the staccato sound of firecrackers and explosions rang out across Martyr’s Square in the heart of Tripoli, for once it was not Libya’s militias battling it out for a larger stake in the country’s oil economy, but a huge firework display celebrating the reopening of one of the finest museums in the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Museum of Libya – housing Africa’s greatest collection of classical antiquities in Tripoli’s historic Red Castle complex – had been closed for nearly 14 years due to the civil war that followed the former dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s downfall. Its ceremonial reopening came at the climax of a lavish show compressing Libya’s rich history and attended by diplomats and Arab celebrities, with a full-size Italian orchestra, acrobats, dancers, arches of fire and lights projected on to the fort. It did not lack for circus drama or cost, peaking with a billowing Ottoman sailing ship arriving high above the port on wires to be greeted by an angelic-appearing Libyan woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/libya-national-museum-reopens"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883d06d8628443e63d4613795e742cfa748901f9/527_713_3668_2935/master/3668.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=aafa63d7493c8c0aa4b8cb6d917b4852" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘We hate it.

Nothing had actually been constructed of this, supposedly the first phase of a high-speed line going north. The only trace was the furtive ecological consultants mapping newts and bats and the train’s looming presence in the minds of those who lived along the route. For many, it was a Westminster vanity project, symbolising a country run against the interests of the many to line the pockets of the few. People whose homes were under threat of demolition&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were petitioning parliament, campaigning for more tunnels or hoping the project would collapse before their farms, paddocks and ancient woodlands were wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line, we were told a decade ago, would be completed by 2026. Like many of the early claims about the longest railway to be built in Britain since the Victorian era, that fact no longer stands. The fast train is running – very – late. The official finish date of 2033 was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/18/hs2-delayed-beyond-2033-high-speed-rail"&gt;recently revised upwards&lt;/a&gt;. “The best guess is that it will begin with a ‘4’ when you can catch a train,” one well-informed observer told me. There’s similar uncertainty about its cost, but one thing is sure: it is catastrophically over budget. When complete, HS2 will almost certainly be the most expensive railway in the world. Nearly 20 years ago, HS1, the line from the Channel tunnel to St Pancras, was completed on time and on budget for £51m per mile (£87m in today’s prices). It was criticised for being twice as expensive as a high-speed route constructed in France. HS2 may cost almost £1bn per mile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/16/we-hate-it-its-desecration-the-real-cost-of-hs2"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d164b0a324b94e0660cbe35105d021db9b4e4bb/542_0_4476_3580/master/4476.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bf642ee323bb96194f88c0883367a255" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Locked down in a Bondi yoga studio amid the carnage outside I felt my world explode | Nadine J Cohen</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/16/bondi-shooting-locked-down-yoga-studio-survivor-story-ntwnfb</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/16/bondi-shooting-locked-down-yoga-studio-survivor-story-ntwnfb</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 04:26:42 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Our community is distraught, but Hanukah is a story of hope overcoming hatred &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most late Sunday afternoons, I do a double yoga class.

Many of these do no harm. As the cancer specialist &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/sep/04/elle-macpherson-breast-cancer-treatment-australian-womens-weekly-misinformation-risk"&gt;Prof Chris Pyke&lt;/a&gt; noted last year, people undergoing cancer treatment will often try meditation or vitamins as well. When such a change is in addition to, and not instead of, evidence-based treatment, this is usually not a problem. If it reduces distress, it can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the proliferation of online health influencers poses challenges that governments and regulators in many countries have yet to grasp. The Guardian’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-birth-keepers"&gt;investigation into the Free Birth Society (FBS)&lt;/a&gt;, a business offering membership and advice to expectant mothers, and training for “birth keepers”, has exposed 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or other serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS. While the company is based in North Carolina, its reach is international.

That means a new economic approach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a year after the election that handed Donald Trump a decisive comeback victory, the Democratic party has still not released its postmortem&amp;nbsp;analysis. But last week, an influential progressive lobby group &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/kamala-harris-election-autopsy"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; its own. Kamala Harris’s campaign, its authors argued, failed to connect with core constituencies because it did not focus enough on addressing basic economic anxieties. By prioritising the menace to democracy that Maga authoritarianism represented, progressives neglected the bread-and-butter issues that were uppermost in many people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the EU braces for a tumultuous period of politics between now and the end of the decade, that is a lesson that needs to be fully absorbed in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. The White House, as its recently published national security strategy makes clear, is hopeful that “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe"&gt;patriotic” parties&lt;/a&gt; in Europe will soon replicate Mr Trump’s success. In the EU’s Franco-German engine room, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; the polls, backed by large swaths of blue-collar voters.

There is an even earlier case. In a trial held by a German court pursuant to the treaty of Versailles (1919), two officers of U-86 were convicted of “an offence against the law of nations” for attacking survivors after the sinking of a Canadian hospital ship, the Llandovery Castle, off the coast of Ireland in the final months of the first world war. The judges said the rule against such attacks was “simple” and “universally known”. They rejected the defence argument that the officers were following orders of the submarine’s captain. They said such an order was manifestly unlawful. The precedent is still cited today and is codified in the Rome statute of the international criminal court. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;William Schabas&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professor of international law, Middlesex University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/dec/15/international-law-on-the-killing-of-people-who-survive-an-attack-at-sea"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/888bc2223191356c1d6e90c4800b049bc30a0c01/739_0_4049_3239/master/4049.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b37472320ee0cd8afcea9aca5ae166d2" medium="image"/></item><item><title>We must not stop research on solar geoengineering | Letters</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/15/we-must-not-stop-research-on-solar-geoengineering</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/15/we-must-not-stop-research-on-solar-geoengineering</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 18:03:04 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryony Worthington &lt;/strong&gt;says the media should not be pushing a western attitude to climate strategies to the detriment of African nations.

The pretext for forming this opinion – and claiming it represents all of Africa – appears to be the brief reference in a joint statement earlier this year from the &lt;a href="https://www.solargeoeng.org/african-ministers-call-for-a-non-use-agreement-on-solar-geoengineering/"&gt;African environmental ministers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t help feeling that the Guardian is being played.

The recipes were not all that intelligent. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; had taken elements of similar recipes from multiple creators and Frankensteined them into something barely recognizable. In &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o"&gt;one memorable case&lt;/a&gt;, the Google AI failed to distinguish the satirical website the Onion from legitimate recipe sites and advised users to cook with non-toxic glue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, bloggers who have not secured their sites behind a paywall have seen their carefully developed and tested recipes show up, often without attribution and in a bastardized form, in ChatGPT replies. They have seen dumbed-down versions of their recipes in AI-assembled cookbooks available for digital downloads on Etsy or on AI-built websites that bear a superficial resemblance to an old-school human-written blog. Their photos and videos, meanwhile, are repurposed in Facebook posts and Pinterest pins that link back to this digital slop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/15/google-ai-recipes-food-bloggers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dad6c44cff97b68d6e8c95e43637b3b460a7a57/398_0_7162_5733/master/7162.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e612fec1c9b4661fc35b370bbd956cb1" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘Just disgraceful’: outcry as Heritage thinktank appoints far-right figure to key post</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/heritage-foundation-thinktank-scott-yenor</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/heritage-foundation-thinktank-scott-yenor</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:00:56 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Scott Yenor, who has offered views on women, marriage and LGBTQ rights, helped to found secretive fraternal order&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Heritage Foundation, an influential rightwing thinktank &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/20/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson"&gt;currently mired in controversy&lt;/a&gt;

Amid all the noise, it’s difficult to know how bad this flu really is – and how much is political spin. I should start by saying “super flu” is not a scientific term or one used by any academics or clinicians I work with. It’s a colloquial phrase that’s been used by various NHS England bosses and taken up by Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/resident-doctors-strike-super-flu-keir-starmer-nhs"&gt;Keir Starmer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, a couple of factors have come together to make it a harder flu season for hospitals to manage. First, flu has arrived earlier than previous years. This isn’t unique to the UK: it’s the same picture across the US, Canada, Japan, Germany – basically the northern hemisphere going into winter. This is in the context of multiple viruses circulating such as Covid and rhinoviruses, which means patients could be fighting one or more viruses at the same time and are more susceptible to getting sicker from influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyond&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Showcased as part of the Highland museum’s virtual Advent calendar on Instagram last week, it’s a late-18th-century Staffordshire pottery flask – to be filled with strong drink and used to toast a safe journey for a traveller – shaped like a very realistic, knobbly spud, complete with green bits. The benefactor who donated the flask apparently explained it was so ugly that no one in his family wanted to inherit it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 15,000 Instagram likers beg to differ, including me: I desperately covet this beauteous and useful tuber, surely the ideal emotional support accessory for the season’s more trying social engagements. As the museum’s representative explains, the potato was “seen as a very fashionable vegetable” back then, and I think we need to think hard about that: why isn’t it now? It might be the most valuable player on the Christmas dining table (don’t even think about arguing), but it’s cruelly taken for granted. Have we ever considered the potato as a gift, an aesthetic, a mood?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/a-potato-is-for-life-not-just-for-christmas"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/335e3cd5ead5a46251bcce2124160d5f44867610/941_362_4771_3817/master/4771.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=409334cc2bb2d77b4e3b0a1c35411ed6" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The US supreme court’s TikTok ruling is a scandal | Evelyn Douek and Jameel Jaffer</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/supreme-court-tiktok-ruling</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/supreme-court-tiktok-ruling</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 11:00:30 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The decision means TikTok now&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of Trump’s pen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judicial opinions allowing the government to suppress speech in the name of national security rarely stand the test of time. But time has been unusually unkind to the US supreme court decision that upheld the law banning &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, the short-form video platform. The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress passed the TikTok ban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia University&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/supreme-court-tiktok-ruling"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a1c7bda187b8142a4f5b6493bab111c7b25ddd6/260_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=92f421a57aab8239c7a438bb1df865c4" medium="image"/></item><item><title>I hate this TV series I’m binge-watching, yet I’m on track to complete all 177 episodes.

What this means, to my dismay, is that I spent five entire days, five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;hours and 15 minutes of this autumn watching this series. In my defence, when I embarked on this rewatch, I was going through quite a trying time in my life. But I would find it difficult to excuse the fact that I didn’t just watch &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;House to take the edge off things, but attempted every single episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a deranged&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;television programme. It’s a tall order to select only a top 10 of the most bonkers plotlines – but here’s a representative handful. House kidnaps the star of his favourite medical soap opera because he has diagnosed him with a brain tumour just by watching him on TV. House pays an actor to pretend to die so that he can freak out his staff by bringing her “back to life” in the morgue. House performs surgery on his own leg in his bathtub to excise the tumours he got from taking medicine only approved for use on rats. A member of House’s team spends a whole episode trying to convince a suicidal patient that he deserves to live and is not a bad person, before it is revealed that the patient is a serial killer who has eaten at least 13 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/tv-binge-watching-episodes-house"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ab9e8a2f454ac2ad7f60c58ba5b153749ebec2c/444_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d3f7d643ba7007e0428d7c7cf92b2fd7" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Nancy Pelosi calls female US president in her lifetime unlikely: ‘Marble ceiling’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/nancy-pelosi-female-president</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/nancy-pelosi-female-president</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:00:29 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Former House speaker, 85, expects woman to assume Oval Office this generation but concedes she may not live to see it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, the outgoing congresswoman and former House speaker, has conceded that she may not see a woman be elected US president in her lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Democrat said as much in a &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/14/nancy-pelosi-trump-impeachment-woman-president/87628948007/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawOrxDhleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETF3RWM1cVlkVXZCZlBueDBIc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHjI8_PGx_1HdIFtKmrMcgH2iGIvUmff0XZ9A79dXHB_67YHnqtRItPUmz-8W_aem_g0IG1-JjOGlfn3AEHg5nFQ"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; interview published on Sunday with her &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/nancy-pelosi-democrat-tributes-retirement"&gt;retirement&lt;/a&gt; looming after four decades in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; – and invoked a turn of phrase referring to a metaphorical barrier impeding advancement in a profession that often confronts women and racial minorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/nancy-pelosi-female-president"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac809c2c649abb38a17a9fc0f7f1432010e553e1/397_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=17ca85f45f84d913f23edc98fc76a5e5" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘I consider him my first son’: how living with a baby monkey taught me I’m ready to be a dad</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/15/baby-monkey-jungle-guinea-monkeys-aoe</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/15/baby-monkey-jungle-guinea-monkeys-aoe</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 10:00:30 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;I went from selling flats in Paris to being alone in a cabin in Guinea looking after primates.

To further the appreciation of culture among all the people, to increase respect for the creative individual, to widen participation by all&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the processes and fulfillments of art – this is one of the fascinating challenges of these days.” Those are the words of John F Kennedy, after whom the US’s national performing arts centre is named. The impulse to build it came from Dwight D Eisenhower; it was given JFK’s name after his assassination; and it opened in 1971, to the music of Leonard Bernstein and the choreography of Alvin Ailey, in the presidency of Richard Nixon. The Kennedy Centre, in short, was designed to be bipartisan, a place of gathering for Democrats and Republicans alike, a proud showcase of the best of America’s dance, opera and music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 50 years it carefully trod that line, its board balanced by members of Congress from both sides of the political divide. But it turns out it can take just months to unravel half a century of high-minded purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/trump-takeover-kennedy-center-warning-uk-arts-institutions"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/118ba8da7611735e0152135a4555bbf9ef39c7fd/664_0_6635_5311/master/6635.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a7aa474b85680e5308585b9f242367c9" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Monday briefing: The latest on the deadly attack on Bondi beach’s Jewish community</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/first-edition-bondi-beach-attack</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/first-edition-bondi-beach-attack</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 06:51:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: On Sunday evening local time, two gunmen opened fire on a gathering at Sydney’s famous beach – here’s what we know so far&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.

And our political establishment is allowing it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as I was starting to write this column, an email alert popped up on my screen. “Punters back Nigel for prime minister after Keir Starmer,” it read, placing the Reform leader second in the odds market after Wes Streeting. What a weird, dissonant duality this is. Nigel Farage is in his fourth week of revelations about alleged racist behaviour at school, and yet, here we are. This is one of those twilight-zone moments in British politics, where it seems something is going to “cut through” any minute now. For a moment it seems as if it absolutely will. And then, there’s a loss of momentum and a return to the status quo. In my mind it manifests like a battle of physical forces, acting on one another. Journalistic investigations, testimonies, whistleblowers, all as a sort of storm that blows on a political actor who may be knocked off his feet, but still manages to cling on by his fingernails, until the gale blows over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up scrambles Farage, a few pieces and more than a few &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2025/dec/04/can-farage-survive-racism-allegations-the-latest"&gt;polling points&lt;/a&gt; knocked off him, but still in place. This is, so far, what he is managing to survive – the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/07/nigel-farage-should-apologise-after-racism-allegations-says-former-watchdog-head"&gt;testimonies&lt;/a&gt; of some 28 of Farage’s contemporaries at Dulwich college who have told the Guardian that they experienced or witnessed racist or antisemitic behaviour when he was a teenager. Jewish students were taunted; “gas them,” Farage said, “Hitler was right”. A black student, much younger than the then 17-year-old Farage, was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/05/nigel-farage-former-dulwich-college-pupil-alleges-said-thats-the-way-back-to-africa"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt;: “That’s the way back to Africa.” The allegations amount, in my reading, to a sort of obsessive campaign against minority students, pursued with the kind of bewildering commitment that anyone who has ever been bullied will feel in their bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/nigel-farage-accused-racism-lead-polls-reform-allegations"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48436fcbc46034e894c9480ae12e356f999e86b4/74_0_4076_3261/master/4076.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=22c503466a0ae0f9521b6e68bfc38602" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Young people bearing brunt of UK jobs downturn, thinktank warns</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/15/young-people-bearing-brunt-of-uk-jobs-downturn-thinktank-warns</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/15/young-people-bearing-brunt-of-uk-jobs-downturn-thinktank-warns</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 06:00:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Resolution Foundation report comes in week when data is expected to show October unemployment rise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are bearing the brunt of Britain’s jobs downturn, according to a report, before official figures this week that are expected to show the UK &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/unemployment"&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt; rate rising to 5.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Resolution Foundation thinktank said a “jobs deficit” was pushing a growing number of graduates and non-graduates into unemployment as employers reduced hiring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/15/young-people-bearing-brunt-of-uk-jobs-downturn-thinktank-warns"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b11f036735f33e3554d9860c0af21d79a43dbb43/459_1693_3433_2748/master/3433.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=94dbc30ccd6f26325a57260340a6a485" medium="image"/></item><item><title>‘People were in tears on set’: the emotional return of word-of-mouth sensation Two Doors Down</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/15/two-doors-down-sitcom-christmas-special</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/15/two-doors-down-sitcom-christmas-special</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 06:00:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;The outrageous Scottish sitcom became a sleeper hit – then its co-creator died tragically.

Not because the world needed permission to enjoy pizza – it clearly didn’t – but because the news soothed a longstanding national irritation: France and Japan, recognised in 2010 and 2013, had beaten us to it. For Italy’s culinary patriots, this had become a psychological pebble in the shoe: a tiny, persistent reminder that someone else had been validated first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the strength of Italian cuisine has never rested on an ancient, coherent culinary canon. Most of what passes for ancient “regional tradition” was assembled in the late 20th century, largely for tourism and domestic reassurance. The real history of Italian food is turbulent: a saga of hunger, improvisation, migration, industrialisation and sheer survival instinct. It is not a serene lineage of grandmothers, sunlit tables and recipes carved in marble. It is closer to a national long-distance sprint from starvation – not quite the imagery Italy chose to present to Unesco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberto Grandi is the author of La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste and a professor of food history at the University of Parma&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/15/myth-traditional-italian-cuisine-food"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db07b445fc0578563d0bcec7312dd6cd975ccaa/667_248_3572_2858/master/3572.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0924ebad0d7d7fac97517472752a5aa3" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Assad family live in Russian luxury as Bashar ‘brushes up on ophthalmology’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/assad-family-live-in-russian-luxury-as-bashar-brushes-up-on-ophthalmology</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/assad-family-live-in-russian-luxury-as-bashar-brushes-up-on-ophthalmology</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 05:00:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Family friend, sources in Russia and Syria, and leaked data help give rare insight into life of dictator’s reclusive household&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, a group of teenage boys spray-painted a warning on to a wall in their school playground: “It’s your turn, Doctor.” The graffiti was a thinly veiled threat that Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, a London-trained ophthalmologist, would be next in the line of Arab dictators toppled by the then raging Arab spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took 14 years, during which 620,000 were killed and nearly 14 million displaced, but eventually the doctor’s turn came and Assad was deposed, fleeing to Moscow in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/assad-family-live-in-russian-luxury-as-bashar-brushes-up-on-ophthalmology"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb60da7b759a6480a6b4698ca591177c19746f3c/191_0_1907_1526/master/1907.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0cdb2f5bfb499c6b9f6c15f37e9050a4" medium="image"/></item><item><title>The snail farm don: is this the most brazen tax avoidance scheme of all time? – podcast</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/dec/15/the-snail-farm-don-is-this-the-most-brazen-tax-avoidance-scheme-of-all-time-podcast</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/dec/15/the-snail-farm-don-is-this-the-most-brazen-tax-avoidance-scheme-of-all-time-podcast</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 05:00:24 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Terry Ball – renowned shoe salesman, friend to former mafiosi – has vowed to spend his remaining years finding ways to cheat authorities he feels have cheated him.

As I did so, I was immediately assailed by imagery of bodies lying on the ground, barely hidden from view. I closed these videos immediately, knowing the way this imagery can stick in one’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When terrible events such as yesterday’s attack occur, we often race to find out as much as possible about what happened. We do so by trawling social media and news sites. This is a natural way of making sense of events, and reflects a human urge to know what is occurring around us in order to keep us safe. Sometimes it’s a more prurient interest, like the way we slow down to look at a crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ahona Guha is a clinical and forensic psychologist, trauma expert and author from Melbourne.

European leaders to join day two of talks in Berlin. What we know on day 1,391&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The head of Britain’s foreign spy service, known as MI6, will warn that Russia poses an “aggressive, expansionist, and revisionist” threat&lt;/strong&gt;, in her first speech since taking office. Blaise Metreweli took over from Richard Moore in October, becoming the first female chief of MI6. “[Vladimir] Putin should be in no doubt, our support is enduring. The pressure we apply on Ukraine’s behalf will be sustained,” Metreweli will say on Monday, according to advance extracts of her remarks. “The export of chaos is a feature not a bug in the Russian approach to international engagement, and we should be ready for this to continue until Putin is forced to change his calculus,” she said, according to the extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, &lt;strong&gt;Richard Knighton, head of Britain’s armed forces&lt;/strong&gt;, will also call in a separate speech on Monday for a &lt;strong&gt;“whole society” approach&lt;/strong&gt; to defence in the face of growing uncertainty and threats, and highlight an increased probability of Russia invading a Nato country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian leader called on Sunday for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt; as he attended talks with US figures in Berlin – the latest efforts to end the war with Russia. “Ukraine needs peace on dignified terms, and we are ready to work as constructively as possible. The coming days will be filled with diplomacy. It is critically important that it delivers results,” Zelenskyy said on X. He later added ahead of a meeting with US officials: “The key thing is that all the steps we agree on with partners must work in practice to deliver guaranteed security. Only reliable guarantees can deliver peace.” Zelenskyy is expected to comment on the talks once they are completed on Monday, &lt;strong&gt;when they are expected to be joined by other European leaders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian leader said that a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia along the current frontlines would be a fair option&lt;/strong&gt; in any peace deal. Russia has demanded Kyiv withdraw its troops from parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that Ukraine still holds. Answering questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat, Zelenskyy reiterated that option would be unfair, adding that the issue of territory remained unresolved and very sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US special envoy Steve Witkoff said “a lot of progress was made” at the first day of talks.&lt;/strong&gt; The meeting between US and Ukrainian delegations included Witkoff, president Zelenskyy, Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and European officials. “Representatives held in-depth discussions ... a lot of progress was made, and they will meet again tomorrow morning,” Witkoff said in a post on X. The talks ended after more than five hours on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/14/ukraine-willing-to-drop-ambitions-to-join-nato-zelenskyy-says"&gt;offer to forgo joining the Nato&lt;/a&gt; military alliance probably will not significantly change the course of peace talks, two security experts said on Sunday.&lt;/strong&gt; “This doesn’t move the needle at all,” said Justin Logan, director of defence and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. “It’s an effort to appear reasonable.” Nato membership for Ukraine has not been realistic in a long time anyway, said Logan and Andrew Michta, a professor of strategic studies at the University of Florida. Michta called Ukraine’s Nato admittance a “non-issue” at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin said on Sunday that Nato secretary general Mark Rutte’s remarks about preparing for war with Russia were irresponsible&lt;/strong&gt; and showed that he did not really understand the devastation of the second world war. Rutte, in a speech in Berlin on Thursday, said that Nato should be “prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured” and asserted that “we are Russia’s next target”. “Kremlin spokespersonDmitry Peskov told state television reporter Pavel Zarubin: “They have no understanding, and unfortunately, Mr Rutte, making such irresponsible statements, simply does not understand what he is talking about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drone fragments caused a fire near the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia’s Krasnodar region without inflicting any injuries or damage&lt;/strong&gt;, an emergency centre said on Sunday. “A gas pipe caught fire outside the refinery near one of the checkpoints. The fire covered an area of 100sqm and has since been extinguished,” the centre said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine had said earlier that its military had hit the refinery and an oil depot in the Russian Volgograd region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that its forces had captured the village of Varvarivka in Ukraine’s eastern Zaporizhzhia region&lt;/strong&gt;. Reuters could not verify battlefield reports of the both sides of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/ukraine-war-briefing-britains-spy-chief-to-warn-of-russias-expansionist-threat-as-berlin-talks-enter-second-day"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><media:content url="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1815a7ffd2fe76610736b5e197e5f42c52c7aafe/253_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e774b4a87452d565f2f28d5eb2238403" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Jimmy Lai verdict: Hong Kong court to decide on national security charges against pro-democracy figure – live</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/15/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-court-national-security-charges-live</link><guid>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/15/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-court-national-security-charges-live</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 02:20:41 +0000</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Incarcerated activist and media owner has been on trial for more than two years on national security charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/jimmy-lai-verdict-hong-kong-judges-national-security-charges"&gt;Jimmy Lai verdict: Hong Kong judges set to rule on national security charges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three high court judges have entered the courtroom and taken their seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearing is due to begin and Lai has entered the court, news reports are saying, adding that he waved to his family.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-democrats-video-message-to-military-is-seditious-behavior-punishable-by-death"&gt;said it was seditious&lt;/a&gt; for Democratic members of Congress to inform members of the military that they can, and indeed, must, resist patently illegal orders, and the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze832dr2n0o"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/us/politics/senator-mark-kelly-investigation-navy.html"&gt;Pentagon are reportedly investigating the members’ speech&lt;/a&gt;. Those related developments – the murder of civilians and an attack on free speech – exemplify two of Trump’s principal tactics in his second term. The first involves the assertion of extraordinary emergency powers in the absence of any actual emergency. The second seeks to suppress dissent by punishing those who dare to raise their voices. Both moves have been replicated time and time again since January 2025. How courts and the public respond will determine the future of constitutional democracy in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more essential to a liberal democracy than the rule of law – that is, the notion that a democratic government is guided by laws, not discretionary whims; that the laws respect basic liberties for all; and that independent courts have the authority to hold political officials accountable when they violate those laws. These principles, forged in the United Kingdom, adopted and revised by the United States, are the bedrock of constitutional democracy. But they depend on courts being willing and able to check government abuse, and citizens exercising their rights to speak out in defense of the fundamental values when those values are under attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Cole is the Honorable George J Mitchell professor in law and public policy at Georgetown University and former national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.

While the 6ft 9in center once regularly played more than 80 games in a regular season, he’s hit new career lows, appearing just 40 times on court during the 2024-2025 season. Following the money, however, suggests Thompson is pivoting into a new career. He’s rebranded as a crypto investor, consultant and brand ambassador, bringing his relative cultural cache to the blockchain. Now the host of his own podcast, Courtside Crypto, he has made frequent appearances with other crypto celebrities, such as at the Nasdaq in September, when he &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOtZyFejk7O/?img_index=4"&gt;celebrated the IPO of an explicitly nationalist Bitcoin mining operation&lt;/a&gt; alongside Eric Trump; Thompson has also developed a crypto startup slated to launch in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, crypto is back in style in Washington and among a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-05/celebrities-are-returning-to-the-crypto-salesforce"&gt;growing set in Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, where Thompson lives adjacent to the Kardashian clan, some of whom have been crypto spokespeople. Donald Trump has reversed Joe Biden’s legal offensive against crypto, debuting his own token, $Trump, before his inauguration, and rolling back government actions against the industry, which heavily supported him during his bid for the presidency.

Sherman, an associate producer of CBS Evening News Plus at the time, suspected that he would be laid off. CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, had closed a merger with the Hollywood studio Skydance in August, and planned to slash &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/business/media/paramount-layoffs-skydance.html"&gt;more than 2,000 jobs&lt;/a&gt; as part of corporate restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherman, who is Black, and Reiter, who is white, had an amicable conversation, according to Sherman. Reiter told Sherman that he was being laid off because his show was being eliminated, Sherman said, and that Reiter was unable to assign the team to other positions.

Some of Berlin’s most renowned clubs have long insisted that the camera lenses on their clientele’s phones must be covered up using this simple method, to ensure that everyone is present in the moment and people can let go without fear of their image suddenly appearing on some online platform. As one DJ &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/music/stickers-on-phone-cameras-berlin.html"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “Do you really want to be in someone’s picture in your jockstrap?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venues in London, Manchester and New York now enforce the same rules. Last week brought news of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/06/manchester-club-sankeys-reopening-2026"&gt;the return of Sankeys&lt;/a&gt;, the famous Mancunian club that closed nearly a decade ago, and is reopening in a 500-capacity space in the heart of the city. The aim, it seems, is to fly in the face of the massed closures of such venues, and revive the idea that our metropolises should host the kind of nights that stretch into the following morning. But there is another basic principle at work: phones will reportedly either be stickered or forbidden. “People need to stop taking pictures and start dancing to the beat,” &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/superclub-sankeys-back-first-time-32942151"&gt;said one of the club’s original founders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said a shelter-in-place was in effect for the area and encouraged people living near the campus to stay inside and not to return home until it was lifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital&lt;/strong&gt;, where six were in critical but stable condition, according to Kelly Brennan, a spokesperson for the hospital. A ninth person was later found to have been injured, but was reportedly not in a critical situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University officials initially told students and staff that a suspect was in custody, before later saying that was not the case and that police were still searching for a suspect or suspects&lt;/strong&gt;. The mayor said a person preliminarily thought to be involved was detained but was later determined to have no involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Donald Trump told reporters that he had been briefed on the shooting&lt;/strong&gt; and “all we can do right now is pray for the victims.” Earlier he claimed a suspect was in custody before rowing back on that statement and confirming the shooter was still at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The shooting occurred in the Barus + Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department&lt;/strong&gt;.

A common thread runs through much of their guidance: Americans, especially those in positions of power, must find the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/china-government-authoritarian.html"&gt;courage&lt;/a&gt; to stand up for what is right, even when doing so carries personal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet few have addressed the harder questions: how does one become courageous?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research shows that the British colonial wealth extraction system still influences the region’s tourist industry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luxury tourism in the Caribbean sells a kind of timelessness. A paradise of sun, sea and sand. But to step off the cruise ship or away from the all-inclusive resort is to see a more complex picture: a history of colonialism and a future of climate devastation. New &lt;a href="https://visualising-extractive-capitalism.common-wealth.org/"&gt;research from the Common Wealth thinktank&lt;/a&gt; maps how, over the 400 years since the first English ships arrived in Barbados, empire engineered a system of wealth extraction that shapes the tourism economies of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hilary-beckles"&gt;Hilary Beckles&lt;/a&gt;, Barbadian historian and chair of the &lt;a href="https://caricomreparations.org/"&gt;Caricom Reparations Commission&lt;/a&gt;, describes Barbados as the birthplace of British slave society. Between 1640 and 1807, Britain transported about 387,000 enslaved west Africans to the island. Extraordinary violence, from whippings to amputations and executions, were a regular feature of their lives. On the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/25/beatings-brandings-suicides-life-on-plantations-owned-by-church-of-england-missionary-arm"&gt;Codrington Plantation&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-18th century, 43% of the enslaved died within three years of their arrival. Life expectancy at birth for an enslaved person on the island was &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/203517"&gt;29 years old&lt;/a&gt;. This was the incalculable human cost of the transatlantic slave economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/dec/12/rebranded-plantations-how-empire-shaped-luxury-caribbean-tourism"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s much more to do, but we should be encouraged by the progress we have made&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris climate treaty, one of the landmark days in climate-action history. Attending the conference as a journalist, I watched and listened and wondered whether 194 countries could ever agree on anything at all, and the night before they did, people who I thought were more sophisticated than me assured me they couldn’t. Then they did. There are a lot of ways to tell the story of what it means and where we are now, but any version of it needs respect for the complexities, because there are a lot of latitudes between the poles of total victory and total defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been dreading the treaty anniversary as an occasion to note that we have not done nearly enough, but in July I thought we might be able celebrate it. Because, on 23 July, the international court of justice handed down an epochal ruling that gives that treaty enforceable consequences it never had before. It declares that all nations have a legal obligation to act in response to the climate crisis, and, as Greenpeace International &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/77262/international-court-justice-historic-advisory-opinion-climate-impacts/"&gt;put&lt;/a&gt; it, “obligates states to regulate businesses on the harm caused by their emissions regardless of where the harm takes place. Significantly, the court found that the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is fundamental for all other human rights, and that intergenerational equity should guide the interpretation of all climate obligations.” The Paris treaty was &lt;a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/node/205627"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly as groundwork for this decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/paris-climate-treaty-anniversary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dying is a process and in a person’s final hours and days, Nickie and her Threshold Choir are there to accompany people on their way and bring comfort. Through specially composed songs, akin to lullabies, the choir cultivates an environment of love and safety around those on their deathbed. For the volunteer choir members, it is also an opportunity to channel their own experiences of grief and together open up conversations about death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With thanks to onscreen contributor, Lindsey, who died since the making of this film&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full interview with Nickie Aven, available &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2025/dec/12/threshold-the-choir-who-sing-to-the-dying-documentary"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/ng-interactive/2025/dec/12/threshold-the-choir-who-sing-to-the-dying-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unhurried trippy bass lines and poet Iona Lee’s commanding, velvety voice conjure a glamorously unhurried sense of  hypnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From&lt;/strong&gt; Edinburgh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended if you like&lt;/strong&gt; Dry Cleaning, Massive Attack, Nick Cave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up next&lt;/strong&gt; Warm Days in December out now, new EP due early 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As fixtures of Edinburgh’s gig-turned-performance art scene, Acolyte’s eerie, earthy psychedelia is just as likely to be found on stage at the Traverse theatre as in a steamy-windowed Leith Walk boozer. Their looped bass lines and poet Iona Lee’s commanding, velvety voice conjure a sense of slow-burn hypnosis – and just like their music, Acolyte are glamorously unhurried. They’ve released only a handful of songs in the seven years since Lee and bassist Ruairidh Morrison first started experimenting with jazz, trip-hop and spoken word, but now the group (with Daniel Hill on percussion and Gloria Black on synth, also known for throwing fantastical, papier-mache-costumed club nights with her former band Maranta) are gathering pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/12/add-to-playlist-the-slow-burn-psychedelia-of-acolyte-and-the-weeks-best-new-tracks"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists in Kansas believe Kernza could cut emissions, restore degraded soils and reshape the future of agriculture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the concrete floor of a greenhouse in rural Kansas stands a neat grid of 100 plastic plant pots, each holding a straggly crown of strappy, grass-like leaves. These plants are perennials – they keep growing, year after year. That single characteristic separates them from soya beans, wheat, maize, rice and every other major grain crop, all of which are annuals: plants that live and die within a single growing season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These plants are the winners, the ones that get to pass their genes on [to future generations],” says Lee DeHaan of &lt;a href="https://landinstitute.org/"&gt;the Land Institute&lt;/a&gt;, an agricultural non-profit based in Salina, Kansas. If DeHaan’s breeding programme maintains its current progress, the descendant of these young perennial crop plants could one day usher in a wholesale revolution in agriculture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/soil-is-more-important-than-oil-inside-the-perennial-grain-revolution"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Taylor Swift: The End of an Era review – as she breaks down over the terror plot, it’s impossible not to feel her pain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The singer’s tears over the Islamic State terrorist plot against her show and Southport attack make this behind-the-scenes docuseries about her world-conquering tour more moving than anyone could have anticipated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swifties had long guessed that there would be a documentary going behind the scenes of Taylor Swift’s blockbuster Eras tour. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/13/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-concert-film-review-a-cacophonous-testament-to-mega-stardom"&gt;2023 Eras Tour concert movie&lt;/a&gt; didn’t show any of the inner workings of this three-and-a-half-hour behemoth, which ran for 149 dates from 2023-24. Fans put some bits together, such as how Swift arrived on stage being pushed inside a cleaning cart. Plus, given the two albums she wrote during and about the Eras tour – 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department and this year’s The Life of a Showgirl – it wouldn’t be Swiftian to overlook another lucrative IP extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What fans could never have imagined was that Disney was set to start filming as the Eras tour was due to hit Vienna on 8 August 2023 – the first of three shows in the Austrian capital that were cancelled owing to an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/14/syrian-boy-trial-alleged-plot-bomb-taylor-swift-concert-vienna"&gt;Islamic State terrorist plot&lt;/a&gt;. We learn this in episode one of the six-part docuseries The End of an Era, when Swift and her longtime friend Ed Sheeran are backstage at Wembley, hours before he guests at her first concert after the thwarted attack. “I didn’t even get to go,” Swift tells him of Vienna. “I was on the plane headed there. I just need to do this show and re-remember the joy of it because I’m a little bit just like …” She can’t find the words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/12/taylor-swift-the-end-of-an-era-review-disney"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘If we build it, they will come’: Skövde, the tiny town powering up Sweden’s video game boom</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/12/skovde-sweden-video-games-goat-simulator-valheim-v-rising</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It started with a goat. Now – via a degree for developers and an incubator for startups – the tiny city is churning out world-famous video game hits. What is the secret of its success?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 26 March 2014, a trailer for a video game appeared on YouTube. The first thing the viewer sees is a closeup of a goat lying on the ground, its tongue out, its eyes open. Behind it is a man on fire, running backwards in slow motion towards a house. Interspersed with these images is footage of the goat being repeatedly run over by a car. In the main shot, the goat, now appearing backwards as well, flies up into the first-floor window of a house, repairing the glass it smashed on its way down. It hurtles through another window and back to an exploding petrol station, where we assume its journey must have started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wordless, strangely moving video – a knowing parody of the trailer for a zombie survival game called Dead Island – was for a curious game called Goat Simulator. The game was, unsurprisingly, the first to ever put the&amp;nbsp;player into the hooves of a goat, who must enact as much wanton destruction as possible. It was also the first massive hit to come out of a small city in Sweden by the name of Skövde.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/12/skovde-sweden-video-games-goat-simulator-valheim-v-rising"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lawyers say people ‘don’t feel safe to leave their home’ as officials target recent arrivals and those awaiting hearings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigration agents appear to be increasingly arresting and detaining Afghan asylum seekers, especially men, who have arrived in the US recently and are awaiting court hearings to decide their cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amir – an asylum seeker who came to the US via Mexico in 2024 – was driving home from his English class in Bloomington, Indiana just after noon on Monday, when he was pulled over by an unmarked police vehicle. Minutes later, the asylum seeker from Afghanistan was cuffed and driven to a detention center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/12/afghan-asylum-seekers-immigration"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Senior commanders accused of atrocities against civilians face asset freezes – but no action against key backer UAE  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has placed sanctions on four senior commanders of Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces suspected of involvement in “heinous” &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/05/rsf-massacres-sudanese-city-el-fasher-slaughterhouse-satellite-images"&gt;violence against civilians in the city of El Fasher&lt;/a&gt;, but decided not to take any action against their key military and diplomatic backer, the United Arab Emirates, or their chief commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British officials suggested they preferred to use their leverage with the UAE and the RSF commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, privately, but admitted there was little sign of a ceasefire in Sudan’s near three-year civil war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/uk-sanctions-four-rsf-commanders-heinous-violence-against-sudan-civilians"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With ICE targeting vendors and fear rising, community groups are organising fast to keep New Yorkers working on the streets safe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a December day when temperatures dipped below 20 degrees, Street Vendor Project staff walked along a busy commercial street in the Bronx, handing out “know your rights” information to vendors selling fruits and vegetables. Several vendors mentioned they were scared after watching videos of immigration raids across the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used to go around helping vendors apply for permits so they wouldn’t get fined,” said Eric Nava-Pérez, Street Vendor Project’s Spanish-speaking member organizer. “But now, we’re out here distributing immigration rights information.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/12/new-york-street-vendors-ice-national-guard"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Comforting reassurance was once the work of the church. Now it’s increasingly being sought from the machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few summers ago I attended two funerals in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One was for a man who was atheist and had lots of worldly success. The second was for a woman who was Catholic, raised three children and lived a much quieter life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a special way of being afraid&lt;br /&gt;
 No trick dispels. Religion used to try,&lt;br /&gt;
 That vast moth-eaten musical brocade&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Welcome to the 2026 World Cup shakedown! The price of a ticket: the integrity of the game | Marina Hyde</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In World Cup parlance, Qatar was Fifa president Gianni Infantino’s qualifier. Now it’s the big time for Trump’s dictator-curious protege&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to think Fifa’s recent practice of holding the World Cup in autocracies was because it made it easier for world football’s governing body to do the things it loved: spend untold billions of other people’s money and siphon the profits&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;without having to worry about boring little things like human rights or public opinion. Which, let’s face it, really piss around with your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for a while now, that view has seemed ridiculously naive, a bit like assuming Recep Erdoğan followed Vladimir Putin’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/26/turkey-people-protest-street-authoritarian-leader"&gt;election-hollowing gameplan&lt;/a&gt; just because hey, he’s an interested guy who likes to read around a lot of subjects. So no: Fifa president Gianni Infantino hasn’t spent recent tournaments cosying up to authoritarians because it made his life easier. He’s done it to learn from the best. And his latest decree this week simply confirms Fifa is now a fully operational autocracy in the classic populace-rinsing style. Do just absorb yesterday’s news that the &lt;em&gt;cheapest&lt;/em&gt; ticket for next year’s World Cup final in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/11/world-cup-2026-ticket-prices-fifa"&gt;will cost £3,120&lt;/a&gt; – seven times more than the cheapest ticket for the last World Cup final in Qatar. (Admittedly, still marginally cheaper than an off-peak single from London to Manchester.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/2026-world-cup-fifa-trump-gianni-infantino-donald-trump"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Martin Compston and Meera Syal are among the names in this tale of divorcees hitting back at their exes. It’s a thriller, comedy and psychodrama all at once – but could maybe do with being more simple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes three-in-one type things are good. Phone chargers with lots of leads for all your devices that have stupidly different ports. Those woolly hats that cover your neck and lower face, so you look daft but are impregnable to winter cold. The Nars blusher stick that is also a lipstick and eyeshadow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to dramas, however, it’s best to stick to one field of endeavour. The Revenge Club is a gallimaufry of tones, styles and performances. Watching it is like looking through a kaleidoscope that someone twists for you every few minutes; it’s fun but quite disorienting after a while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/12/the-revenge-club-review-this-starry-divorce-caper-makes-you-want-to-laugh-and-cry-at-the-same-time"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An array of under-the-radar initiatives are taking hold across the US, often tied to immunization, fluoridation and raw milk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even within the freak show that is Donald Trump’s cabinet, the health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has a singular knack for dominating the headlines with the most disturbing sort of carnivalesque spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, he’s amplified harmful misinformation linking &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/reupping-unproven-claims-about-tylenol-kennedy-claims-a-link-between-circumcision-and-autism"&gt;Tylenol and autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-06-13/kennedy-new-cdc-panel-vaccine-misinformation"&gt;dismissed&lt;/a&gt; the entire CDC vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with skeptics and conspiracy theorists. And even as that agency &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/health/cdc-vaccine-committee-newborns-hepatitis-b.html"&gt;debated&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/cdc-panel-rfk-hepatitis-b-vaccine"&gt;scrapped &lt;/a&gt;its hepatitis B vaccination recommendation for many newborns, Kennedy courted further controversy for his &lt;a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/12/03/2025/kennedy-likely-to-stay-silent-as-nuzzi-lizza-feud-rages-on"&gt;alleged involvement&lt;/a&gt; in a tabloid-fodder love triangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor and publisher of the Nation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a contributor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/rfk-jr-public-health-danger-maha-local-laws"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the classic album hits 50, Nick Mason talks about the often difficult process of making it and how it has since fit into their larger catalogue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By almost every measure, from commercial reward to creative reach, Pink Floyd scaled its peak on Dark Side of the Moon. But, when I asked drummer Nick Mason how he would rank the album in their catalogue, he slotted it below the set that came next, Wish You Were Here. Speaking of Dark Side, he said, “the idea of it is almost more attractive than the individual songs on it. I feel slightly the same about Sgt. Pepper. It’s an amazing album that taught us a hell of a lot, but the individual parts are not quite as exciting, or as good, as some of the other Beatles’ albums.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, he says of Wish You Were Here, “there’s something in the general atmosphere it generates – the space of it, the air around it, that’s really special,” he said. “It’s one of the reasons I view it so affectionately.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/12/50-years-pink-floyd-wish-you-were-here-album"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Donald Trump is pursuing regime change – in Europe | Jonathan Freedland</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US made it clear this week that it plans to help the parties of the European far right gain power. Keir Starmer and his fellow leaders have to face this new reality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When are we going to get the message? I joked a few months back that, when it comes to Donald Trump, Europe needs to learn from Sex and the City’s Miranda Hobbes and realise that “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/28/donald-trump-orange-hurricane-keir-starmer-warn-britain-danger"&gt;He’s just not that into you&lt;/a&gt;”. After this past week, it’s clear that understates the problem. Trump’s America is not merely indifferent to Europe – it’s positively hostile to it. That has enormous implications for the continent and for Britain, which too many of our leaders still refuse to face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depth of US hostility was revealed most explicitly in the new &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf"&gt;US national security strategy&lt;/a&gt;, or NSS, a 29-page document that serves as a formal statement of the foreign policy of the second Trump administration. There is much there to lament, starting with the sceptical quote marks that appear around the sole reference to “climate change”, but the most striking passages are those that take aim at Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Europe must realise its superior economic and military potential has to be mobilised, writes &lt;strong&gt;Bill Jones, &lt;/strong&gt;while &lt;strong&gt;Robin Wilson &lt;/strong&gt;addresses Belgium’s resistance to seizing Russian assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wholly support the plea to Europe by Timothy Garton Ash (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/06/europe-ukraine-putin-trump-eu"&gt;Only Europe can save Ukraine from Putin and Trump – but will it?, 6 December&lt;/a&gt;). One aspect he did not mention was the strategic nuclear balance. Since the late 1940s, responsibility for deterrence has always lain with the Pentagon and has succeeded in keeping the peace, though at times a very fragile version of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent US statement on defence makes it clear that Europe is no longer seen as a priority by the Trump administration, the danger now being that doubt is crucially being raised as to the credibility of Nato’s deterrent. Without certainty of a reaction in kind, Russia, under its ambitious and risk-taking president, might be tempted to chance its arm in what almost looks like a ceding of Europe by the US into a Russian “sphere of influence”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/the-importance-of-europe-in-curbing-russias-might"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guardian readers share their views on a proposed shorter working week for educators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teacher who already works four days (albeit I don’t get paid for the fifth), I can wholeheartedly say it has transformed my relationship with the job (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/09/four-day-week-schools-parents-teachers-england-wales"&gt;‘Bring it on!’: growing support in England for four-day week in schools, 9 December&lt;/a&gt;). I no longer have the dread of weekends and holidays with insurmountable mountains of work. The move to a four-day teaching week would need to be thought about carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, for one, would not want to have one full day out of school – this would mean four straight days of teaching. In most schools, a day not teaching would equate to five planning, preparation and assessment periods (PPAs).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/12/will-a-four-day-week-for-teachers-work"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

But let’s be clear about the strikes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/12/christmas-strikes-resident-doctors-jenga-piece-collapses-nhs-wes-streeting"&gt;planned by resident doctors&lt;/a&gt; next week. They should not happen. They are reckless. They place the NHS and patients who need it in grave danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remain hopeful they can be averted. A good deal is on the table, and the British Medical Association (BMA) is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/10/resident-doctors-in-england-to-consult-on-calling-off-strikes"&gt;putting it to members&lt;/a&gt; this weekend.

      <title>Hunger’s whip: why connecting US food stamps to work is outdated and ineffective</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/snap-food-stamp-work-requirement</link>
      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/snap-food-stamp-work-requirement</guid>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In many parts of the country, there are new work requirements to get food aid. But starving people doesn’t motivate them – despite centuries of this rhetoric&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 200 years, common wisdom and policymakers have assumed that to get people to work, you had to make them hungry. New work requirements for Snap food benefits, which went into effect in most of the US on 1 December, are only the latest in a long line of policies based on this idea. The new rules cut off benefits for any non-disabled adult up to age 65 who cannot prove that they are working or seeking work at least 80 hours every month (that includes homeless people, veterans and former foster youth). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that &lt;a href="https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/"&gt;2.7 million people will lose their benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard this reasoning before: people are motivated to work because they and their families have to survive. If you give someone welfare – especially food aid – they become dependent and lazy. The Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative thinktank that has been campaigning for years to cut welfare, calls this “&lt;a href="https://thefga.org/research/universal-work-requirements/"&gt;the dependency trap&lt;/a&gt;”. Starving people by taking away their food stamps is supposed to “incentivize individuals to better themselves and transition from dependency to work and self-reliance”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/snap-food-stamp-work-requirement"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Readers respond to a report highlighting harsh disciplinary regimes at a school in east London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s little wonder that parents at Mossbourne Victoria Park academy (MVPA) are calling on the leadership of the school “to change course or be replaced” (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/09/london-academy-staff-instilled-climate-of-fear-among-pupils"&gt;London academy staff instilled ‘climate of fear’ among pupils&lt;/a&gt;, 9 December). It was a year ago that the Guardian’s John&amp;nbsp;Harris outlined the details of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/15/traumatise-children-education-london-academies-schools"&gt;an investigation&lt;/a&gt; carried out by the Observer into two Mossbourne academy schools, including MVPA. It had found, as Sir Alan&amp;nbsp;Wood has, that for many years horrendous tactics have been used to enforce discipline. Many staff were appalled and left, with the final straw for many being a teachers’ training session entitled “healthy fear”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/15/traumatise-children-education-london-academies-schools"&gt;Harris concluded &lt;/a&gt;then that there were “big questions about how academies and so-called free schools are scrutinised and overseen”, and it is certainly difficult to explain how Ofsted inspectors, regardless of the schools’ good examination results, could fail to notice both the appalling ways discipline was being enforced and the shocking after‑effects. Both schools were awarded the “outstanding” grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bernie Evans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liverpool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/12/fear-should-have-no-place-in-a-classroom-or-staffroom"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The UK art world is finally becoming more inclusive. But greater support must be given to the organisations that enable disabled artists to flourish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Turner prize is no stranger to sparking debate or pushing boundaries. This year it has achieved both. For the first time, an artist with learning disabilities has&amp;nbsp;won. Glasgow-born &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/10/nnena-kalu-turner-prize-win-interview-disabled-art"&gt;Nnena Kalu&lt;/a&gt; took the award for her colourful, cocoon-like sculptures made from VHS tape, clingfilm and other abandoned materials, along with her large swirling vortex drawings. Kalu is autistic,&amp;nbsp;with limited verbal communication. In an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cjwyn5llzn5t"&gt;acceptance speech&lt;/a&gt; on her behalf, Kalu’s facilitator, Charlotte Hollinshead, said that “a very stubborn glass&amp;nbsp;ceiling” had been broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalu’s win is a high-profile symbol of a shift towards greater inclusivity that has been happening in the UK arts world over the past five years.

      <title>The Guardian view on Trump and Venezuela: a return to seeking regime change | Editorial</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US is ramping up the pressure on Nicolás Maduro with a tanker seizure and expanded sanctions following threats and boat strikes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in his first term, Donald Trump mooted &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/11/donald-trump-venezuela-crisis-military-intervention"&gt;a “military option”&lt;/a&gt; for Venezuela to dislodge its president, Nicolás Maduro. Reports suggest that he &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/04/trump-suggested-invading-venezuela-report"&gt;eagerly discussed&lt;/a&gt; the prospect of an invasion behind closed doors. Advisers eventually talked him down. Instead, the US pursued a “maximum pressure” strategy of sanctions and threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mr Maduro is still in place. And Mr Trump’s attempts to remove him are ramping up again. The US has amassed its largest military presence in the Caribbean since &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/venezuela-panama-invasion-trump"&gt;the 1989 invasion of Panama&lt;/a&gt;. It has carried out more than 20 shocking &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/07/the-guardian-view-on-the-war-on-drugs-donald-trump-is-turning-a-failed-metaphor-into-a-more-dangerous-reality"&gt;strikes on alleged drug boats&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Trump reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/01/trump-maduro-ultimatum-relinquish-power-venezuela"&gt;delivered an ultimatum&lt;/a&gt; late last month, telling the Venezuelan leader that he could have safe passage from his country if he left immediately. There was already a $50m bounty on his head. This week came expanded sanctions and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/lawmakers-venezuela-oil-tanker"&gt;seizure of a tanker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Repeated fall storms led to the temporary lake, known as Lake Manly, appearing in basin 282ft beneath sea level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After record-breaking rains, an ancient lake in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2024/jul/12/heatwave-tourism-death-valley-in-pictures"&gt;Death Valley national park&lt;/a&gt; that had vanished has returned to view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temporary lake, known informally as Lake Manly, has appeared once more at the bottom of Badwater Basin, which sits 282ft beneath sea level, in California.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The seizure of the Skipper on Wednesday marked the first US capture of Venezuelan oil cargo since sanctions were imposed in 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan oil exports have reportedly fallen sharply since the US seized a tanker this week and imposed fresh sanctions on shipping companies and vessels doing business with Caracas, according to shipping data, documents and maritime sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast"&gt;seizure of the Skipper tanker off Venezuela’s coast&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday was the first US capture of Venezuelan oil cargo since sanctions were imposed in 2019 and marked a sharp escalation in rising tensions between the Trump administration and the government of Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/13/venezuela-oil-exports-reportedly-fall-sharply-after-us-seizure-of-tanker-skipper"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The former X Factor judge is back, auditioning boyband wannabes for his latest talent show – but gen Z doesn’t seem to care very much, or even know who he is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have we gone back in time to 2010? If only! No, Simon Cowell is just back in the headlines, reasserting his svengali status for his new Netflix show. Reviews suggest that Cowell’s attempted comeback, 15 years since his celebrity peak, highlights less his particular star power than how totally &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/04/simon-cowell-tv-search-boyband"&gt;the world has moved on&lt;/a&gt;. But is there anything to learn from SyCo now, and will his new boyband work? Let’s see!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Cowell is chasing a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;direction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/13/has-simon-cowell-lost-his-mojo-seven-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-music-moguls-new-direction"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The writer’s former partner and her co-star Ruby Ashbourne Serkis describe the bittersweet nature of remounting his 90s play so soon after his death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/dec/01/tom-stoppard-actors-playwright-rufus-sewell-christine-baranski-susan-wokoma-toby-jones-harriet-walter"&gt;‘We were swimming in the mind pool of Tom Stoppard!’ – actors salute the great playwright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t, I promise, refer to Felicity Kendal as Tom Stoppard’s muse. “No,” she says firmly. “Not this week.” Speaking to Stoppard’s former partner and longtime leading lady is delicate in the immediate aftermath of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/nov/29/tom-stoppard-playwright-of-dazzling-wit-and-playful-erudition-dies-aged-88"&gt;the writer’s death&lt;/a&gt;. But she is previewing a revival of his Indian Ink, so he shimmers through the conversation. The way Kendal refers to Stoppard in the present tense tells its own poignant story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settling into a squishy brown sofa at Hampstead theatre, Kendal describes revisiting the 1995 work, developed from a 1991 radio play. “It’s a play that I always thought I’d like to go back to.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Previously starring as Flora Crewe, a provocative British poet visiting 1930s India, she now plays Eleanor Swan, Flora’s sister. We meet Eleanor in the 1980s, fending off an intrusive biographer but uncovering her sister’s rapt and nuanced relationships in India.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/dec/13/felicity-kendal-tom-stoppard-indian-ink-ruby-ashbourne-serkis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As 27 European countries urge changes to laws forged after second world war, human rights chief says politicians are playing into hands of populists&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle had been brewing for months. But this week it came to a head in a flurry of meetings, calls and one heady statement. Twenty-seven European countries urged a rethink of the human rights laws forged after the second world war, describing them as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an impediment when it came to addressing migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International has called it “a moral retreat”. Europe’s most senior human rights official &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/dec/10/keir-starmer-hierarchy-of-people-constraining-human-rights"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the approach risked creating a “hierarchy of people” where some are seen as more deserving of protection than others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/dec/13/europe-echr-rethink-moral-retreat-say-human-rights-experts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I ate 3,000 meals for my ‘best of London restaurants’ list – and I hope you disagree with it | Jonathan Nunn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From pie-and-mash to the swank of a Michelin star, everyone has their own idea of what’s ‘best’. What’s yours?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Nunn is the author of London Feeds Itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 24 years ago, a small British food magazine called Restaurant &lt;a href="https://elbullifoundation.com/press/articulo/the-worlds-50-best-restaurants/"&gt;assembled an all-star panel&lt;/a&gt; – made up of Gordon Ramsay, John Torode, Aldo Zilli and 65 other food guys – to adjudicate on the world’s most stupid question: what is the best restaurant on the planet? It didn’t matter that no judge had been to all the restaurants on the shortlist, or that two of the judges happened to be Jeremy Clarkson and Roger Moore – what the editors of Restaurant understood is that people &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; a list, and if you order a group of restaurants from 50-1 and throw a party, people might take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could run and run,” the editors wrote in their intro, half hoping. They were right. Within two decades, The World’s 50 Best Restaurants had gone from what critic Jay Rayner described as a “&lt;a href="https://forums.egullet.org/topic/41262-restaurant-top-50-2004/page/5/"&gt;terribly successful marketing exercise&lt;/a&gt;” to an insurgent alternative to the ossified Michelin Guide, solidifying the reputations of El Bulli, the Fat Duck and then Noma as the “world’s best restaurant”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Nunn is a food and city writer based in London who co-edits the magazine Vittles.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hobnobs, ricotta, chocolate and amaretto – what’s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe in divine communion, especially when it comes to food; an alliance of ingredients that come together as though they were meant to feed spirit and body. It might be too lofty to say that this semifreddo is divine, but the combination of Hobnobs, ricotta, chocolate and amaretto really does it for me. That said, there are many alliances that can be formed in the Christmas store-cupboard, so use this as a base for any biscuits, dried fruit and chocolate to which you feel most spiritually aligned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/13/christmas-ricotta-semifreddo-recipe-meera-sodha"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goofy star of Mary Poppins becomes a centenarian on Saturday. And what a precocious performer he has proved, sustaining scrappy mischief through seven decades of mainstream entertainment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Hollywood stars grow old and die except perhaps one - Dick Van Dyke - who turns 100 today. The real world Peter Pan who used to trip over the ottoman on The Dick Van Dyke Show is still standing. The man who impersonated a wind-up toy in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang hasn’t wound down just yet. He has outlived mentors, co-stars, romantic partners and several studios. He’s even outlived the jokes about his performance in Mary Poppins. These days his &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/20/do-you-expect-me-to-talk-dick-van-dyke-says-he-turned-down-playing-james-bond"&gt;mangled cockney accent&lt;/a&gt; is regarded with more fondness than contempt. It’s seen as one of the great charms of the 1964 classic, along with the carousel chase or the cartoon dancing penguins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charm is the magic ingredient of every popular entertainer and few have possessed it in such abundance as Van Dyke, the impoverished son of a travelling cookie salesman who dropped out of high school and educated himself at the movies. “His job in this life is to make a happier world,” his Broadway co-star Chita Rivera once said - and this may explain his stubborn refusal to quit, not while times are tough and he feels that audiences still need cheering up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/13/dick-van-dyke-centenarian-100-mary-poppins-chitty-chitty-bang-bang"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Palestinians who have worked the ‘breadbasket’ area for generations face being replaced by Israeli settlers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death knell for the Palestinian village of Atouf, on the western slopes of the Jordan valley, arrived in the form of a trail of paper, a series of eviction notices taped to homes, greenhouses and wells, marking a straight line across the open fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notices, which appeared overnight, informed the local farmers that their land would be confiscated and that they had seven days from the date of their delivery, 4 December, to vacate their properties. A military road and accompanying barrier was to be built by Israel right through the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/13/new-israeli-barrier-slice-through-precious-west-bank-farmland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Edward Enninful: ‘Britain feels less tolerant now than we were in the 90s’</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The former British Vogue editor reflects on his early years in London, the importance of celebrating diversity and why he takes comfort in the younger generation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Edward Enninful was scouted on the tube travelling through London in 1988, it changed his life. The Ghanaian teenager, newly arrived in Britain, was drawn into the capital’s creative scene of the 90s – as a model, then stylist and, by 18, the fashion director of i-D magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was the height of the YBA [Young British Artists] movement – Jay Jopling, Tracey Emin. I met Kate [Moss] at a casting,” he recalls. “Then Naomi [Campbell] for a cover, and I knew we’d be great friends. We all hung out across disciplines. Friday rolled into Saturday into Sunday. I miss that rawness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/13/edward-enninful-interview-former-british-vogue-editor"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Colm Tóibín,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Robert Macfarlane, Elif Shafak, Michael Rosen and more share the novels, poetry and memoirs that make the perfect gift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love giving books as presents. I rarely give anything else. I strongly approve of the Icelandic tradition of the &lt;em&gt;Jólabókaflóðið&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Yule book flood), whereby books are given (and, crucially, read) on Christmas Eve. Nan&amp;nbsp;Shepherd’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/the-living-mountain-9780857861832/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article"&gt;The Living Mountain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the one I’ve given more often than any other; so much so that I keep a stack of four or five to hand, ready to give at Christmas or any other time of the year. It’s a slender masterpiece – a meditation on Shepherd’s lifelong relationship with the Cairngorm mountains, which was written in the 1940s but not published until 1977. It’s “about the Cairngorms” in the sense that Mrs Dalloway is “about London”; which is to say, it is both intensely engaged with its specific setting, and gyring outwards to vaster questions of knowledge, existence and – a word Shepherd uses sparingly but tellingly – love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/13/this-extraordinary-story-never-goes-out-of-fashion-30-authors-on-the-books-they-give-to-everyone"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three sweet treats for even the fussiest sweet tooth: fig and hazelnut crumble mince pies, sherry and raisin ice-cream, and chestnut and pear meringues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of sheer laziness, this is a no-churn, very quick to assemble take on things. I tend usually not to recommend no-churn ice-creams unless there is booze involved, so this sherry and raisin one is a great candidate (the alcohol stops the ice-cream from becoming too hard and crystallised). And keep the leftover egg whites from the mince pies to make the chestnut and pear meringue, an alternative for the Christmas pudding haters at your table – there is always one. I think it’s important to have at least two puddings at Christmas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/13/christmas-desserts-recipes--figgy-crumble-mince-pies-boozy-ice-cream-choc-pear-meringues-flora-shedden"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Australia’s social media ban has given us a way to fight big tech – and get my son back on his skateboard | Sisonke Msimang</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ban on under-16s accessing ‘harmful’ content that began this week has overwhelming approval from adults – even if it had a few teething issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, my 14-year-old went into the garage, pulled out his skateboard and told me this was going to be his “skate park summer”. I was curious about what was sparking his renewed interest in an activity he hadn’t thought about since he was 12. His response: “The ban.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled. As far as I was concerned, Australia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/10/how-the-world-media-covered-australias-under-16s-social-media-ban"&gt;world-first social media law &lt;/a&gt;aimed at preventing children under 16 from accessing social media apps was already a success. But this week, as the ban took effect, my son wasn’t so sure. Access to his accounts remained largely unchanged. Many of his friends were in the same position. Across the country, the rollout has been uneven, as social media companies try to work out how to verify kids’ ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisonke Msimang is the author of Always Another Country: A Memoir of Exile and Home (2017) and The Resurrection of Winnie Mandela (2018)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/13/australia-social-media-ban-fight-big-tech"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The actor, writer and comedian on turning his life around, fancying Cilla Black and his secret nose-picking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Coventry, Guz Khan, 39, was working as a secondary school teacher when he&amp;nbsp;began uploading comedy videos as&amp;nbsp;the character Mobeen in 2014. The following year, he gave up teaching to&amp;nbsp;pursue standup. In 2017, his show Man Like Mobeen was released by the&amp;nbsp;BBC and ran for five series. He won a Royal Television Society award in 2020 and was Bafta-nominated twice. His films include Army of Thieves and The Bubble. Guz Khan’s Custom Cars starts on Quest on 19 January. He is married with five children and lives in the West Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the trait you most deplore in&amp;nbsp;yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Impulsivity. We end up in strange places, like right now – I am in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/13/guz-khan-actor-comedian-writer-interview"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By using music from SZA, Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo in ICE videos, the government is playing a game of rage-bait&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; was engulfed in controversy over its illegal military strikes near Venezuela (among numerous other crises), a Department of Homeland Security employee – I picture the worst sniveling, self-satisfied, hateful loser – got to work on the official X account. The state-employed memelord posted a video depicting Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials arresting people in what appeared to be Chicago, celebrating the humiliation and incarceration of undocumented immigrants as some sort of patriotic achievement. The vile video borrowed, as they often do, from mainstream pop culture; in this case, a viral lyric from Sabrina Carpenter’s song Juno – “Have you ever tried this one?”, referring to sex positions – overlaid on clips of agents chasing, tackling and handcuffing people, cheekily nodding to all the methods in ICE’s terror toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter, as a pre-eminent pop star, was caught in an impossible position. Say nothing, as her friend and collaborator Taylor Swift did weeks earlier when the White House used her music in a Trump hype video, and risk &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/15/taylor-swift-silence-trump-administration-speaks-volumes"&gt;appearing as if you condone&lt;/a&gt; the administration’s use of your art for a domestic terror campaign (the administration hasn’t yet used Swift for an ICE video, but I’m sure it’s coming); or engage, even if to honestly express your utter disgust, and risk bringing more attention to objectionable propaganda designed to provoke a response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/dec/13/trump-ice-video-music"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most exciting places our writers came across this year, from untouched islands in Finland to an affordable ski resort in Bulgaria and the perfect Parisian bistro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a midsummer trip to Ireland, I saw dolphins in the Irish Sea, sunset by the Liffey, and misty views of the Galtee Mountains. The half-hour &lt;a href="https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/station/cobh"&gt;train journey to Cobh&lt;/a&gt; (“cove”), through Cork’s island-studded harbour, was especially lovely. As the railway crossed Lough Mahon, home to thousands of seabirds, there was water on both sides of the train. I watched oystercatchers, egrets, godwits and common terns, which nest on floating pontoons. Curlews foraged in the mudflats, and an old Martello tower stood on a wooded promontory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/dec/13/travel-writers-top-25-favourite-travel-discoveries-europe-2025"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

But high among these culinary heavyweights sits a humble &lt;em&gt;salonu&lt;/em&gt; tucked away in the depths of north London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neco Tantuni, a small Turkish eatery specialising in the foodie delights of Mersin, a city located on the southern coast of Turkey, has been crowned the fourth best restaurant in London by Vittles, the trendy food magazine that has become a bible for those looking for the best (and more off-the-radar) grub in the capital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/13/neco-tantuni-turkish-restaurant-enfield-london-food-vittles-list"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This spectacular image taken in Sakrisøy, Norway, triggered accusations that it was simply too good to be true&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yuan Li splits his time between two careers: in the winter, he works as a ski instructor; in summer, a&amp;nbsp;photographer. When he took this image, Beijing-based Li was visiting Norway and Iceland with friends, on a trip focused on sightseeing and photographing the&amp;nbsp;aurora borealis. He captured this picture while exploring Sakrisøy, a small island in Lofoten, Norway. In the foreground sits this distinctive yellow homestay; in the background, Olstinden mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It had snowed heavily all day,” Li recalls. “As I was setting up to capture this scene, the snow stopped and the sun came out, which made the perfect environment for taking photos.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/13/yuan-li-best-phone-picture"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Will Farage's Trumpian strategy work against him? He has good reason to believe it won't | Samuel Earle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Reform leader bit back over allegations of racial abuse and revealed his strategy: the best form of defence is dragging everyone else into the mire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the allegations of Nigel Farage’s racist and antisemitic school bullying multiplied, it was hard to keep up with his shifting array of responses. At times, in his evasiveness and discomfort, he has looked like that most un-Farage of things: a nervous politician, anxious not to say the wrong word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, however, he angrily returned to his preferred posture: brimming with indignation at the moral hypocrisy of elites. He lashed out at the BBC’s “&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgexg4lz2q5o"&gt;double standards&lt;/a&gt;” for indulging the allegations, when the broadcaster itself showed racist jokes and skits back in those days. Farage announced it was not he who should apologise, but apparently the BBC that should say sorry “for virtually everything you did throughout the 1970s and 1980s”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/13/nigel-farage-bbc-donald-trump-racism-allegations-politics"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US president finds himself shouldering same burdens of affordability crisis and the inexorable march of time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was supposed to be touting the economy but could not resist taking aim at an old foe. “Which is better: Sleepy Joe or Crooked Joe?” Donald Trump teased &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/trump-pennsylvania-affordability-speech"&gt;supporters in Pennsylvania this week&lt;/a&gt;, still toying with nicknames for his predecessor Joe Biden. “Typically, Crooked Joe wins. I’m surprised because to me he’s a sleepy son of a bitch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exulting in Biden’s drowsiness, the US president and his supporters seemed blissfully ignorant of a rich irony: that 79-year-old Trump himself has recently been spotted apparently dozing off at various meetings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/trump-biden-rivals"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US’s national security strategy, shared last week, claims European immigration will cause ‘civilisational erasure’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you create a foreign policy manifesto for a US president who leads from the gut?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial draft fell to Michael Anton, a Maga firebrand whom officials have called the lead author behind the US’s radical new national security strategy (NSS). The document shocked US allies, warning that immigration to Europe would cause “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe"&gt;civilizational erasure&lt;/a&gt;”, reviving the Monroe doctrine in the western hemisphere, and downgrading the US’s responsibility for great power competition with China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/you-and-me-against-the-world-who-was-behind-trumps-anti-europe-foreign-policy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trump’s racist remarks on Ilhan Omar and Somali immigrants reveals his vision for the US as a white Christian nation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rally on &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/trump-poconos-rally-affordability-hoax/"&gt;affordability&lt;/a&gt; in Pennsylvania on 9 December devolved into a racist tirade when Donald Trump said to the crowd: “We only take people from shithole countries. Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few? … From Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the US representative Ilhan Omar’s hijab as a “little turban”, Trump continued: “She should get the hell out. Throw her the hell out.” His supporters erupted in chants of: “Send her back.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/13/ethnic-cleansing-racism-us-trump-ilhan-omar-somalia"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Veja doesn’t do surveys or freebies, hates greenwashing and Black Friday, and as demand for trainers wanes, it continues to go its own way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the grand hierarchy of Paris fashion, it’s tricky for a brand to stand out. Especially one whose &lt;em&gt;coup de maître&lt;/em&gt; is a goes-with-everything white sneaker. Yet 20 years after Veja first began selling sustainable footwear, it has become the ultimate affordable It brand for scooter-wielding mums, sustainably minded millennials and A-list bigwigs who want to wear their values on their ethical leather-clad feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veja’s co-founder Sébastien Kopp says he doesn’t know if people buy his trainers because of how they are made or because of how they look. The company is fastidious about social and fairtrade practices, “but because we don’t do surveys, we don’t do marketing, we simply don’t know this information”, he says, speaking from Veja’s Paris headquarters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/13/veja-ethical-paris-trainer-worn-a-listers-and-royalty"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Teenager who first scrawled messages on pavement in protest at rightwing government did not expect so many others to follow suit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrawled in chalk on the pavement near a secondary school in eastern Slovakia, the messages were short and to the point: “Enough Fico,” read one, echoing a popular anti-government slogan, while the other joked about the Slovakian prime minister providing sexual favours to Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearing hours before the prime minister, Robert Fico, was due to speak at the school, the messages struck a nerve. Similar comments swiftly began sprouting up across Slovakian pavements in what &lt;a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/slovakias-chalk-revolution-puts-robert-fico-on-the-defensive/"&gt;was labelled &lt;/a&gt; the “Chalk Revolution” by some and “November Chalk Wave” &lt;a href="https://tvpworld.com/90060933/slovakia-protests-fico-challenged-by-student-chalk-wave"&gt;by others.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/13/chalk-revolution-slovakia-fears-return-authoritarian-past"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The OpenAI CEO gushed about the bot’s parental-assistance abilities. Is it really his best child-rearing hack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how does he do it all? Every time I look at the news, Sam Altman’s face seems to be staring back at me. The CEO of OpenAI, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny"&gt;a well-known workaholic&lt;/a&gt;, is constantly in the public eye explaining how AI will probably &lt;a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/abundant-intelligence"&gt;cure cancer&lt;/a&gt; and transform the &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/openais-sam-altman-sees-a-future-with-a-collective-superintelligence"&gt;social contract&lt;/a&gt; and generally change the world. While doing all that he’s reportedly gearing up for OpenAI to file for a stock market listing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/30/openai-1tn-stock-market-float-ipo"&gt;valuing&lt;/a&gt; the company at $1tn, as soon as next year. And he’s also a new dad: Altman and his husband, Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their first child into the world in February. So he’s got a lot on his plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/13/openai-parental-assistance"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Duchess of Sussex says journalistic ethics breached as dad turns to journalist first to break news of leg amputation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Thomas Markle received bad news about his health earlier this month, he immediately texted someone close to him to let them know. The 81-year-old had been admitted to hospital after one leg swelled up and turned black. “Going to lose the leg today,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message was not sent to his son, Thomas, who lives with him in Cebu in the Philippines, nor to his older daughter, Samantha, who is based in Florida. Instead, Markle contacted Caroline Graham, the US editor of the Mail on Sunday, who is based in Los Angeles. It was she who called Markle’s two older children to let them know the news. She &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15360281/estranged-Meghan-Harry-Thomas-Markle-hospital.html"&gt;wrote later&lt;/a&gt; that they were “flabbergasted”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/13/meghan-duchess-sussex-mail-on-sunday-us-editor-rock-solid-friend-father"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;California governor says order pushes ‘grift and corruption’ instead of innovation just hours after president’s dictum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ink was barely dry on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/trump-executive-order-artificial-intelligence"&gt;Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence executive order&lt;/a&gt; when Gavin Newsom came out swinging. Just hours after the order went public Thursday evening, the California governor issued a statement saying the presidential dictum, which seeks to block states from regulating AI of their own accord, advances “grift and corruption” instead of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“President Trump and David Sacks aren’t making policy – they’re running a con,” Newsom said, referencing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/05/trump-david-sacks-ai-crypto"&gt;Trump’s AI adviser and crypto “czar”&lt;/a&gt;. “Every day, they push the limits to see how far they can take it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/13/california-ai-executive-order-trump-gavin-newsom"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forward made an emotional lap of honour at Anfield after a week that put his future at the club in doubt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohamed Salah and Liverpool have put politics to shame by showing what a long week truly looks like. It ended with the Egyptian doing a one-man lap of honour at Anfield, an attempt to rebuild trust with the supporters after creating a ceasefire, if not a complete truce, with Arne Slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past seven days a lot has changed, but one thing remained the same, Salah started a Premier League game on the bench, not that he needed to wait long for a chance to do his talking on the pitch. He would finish with an assist after playing 75 minutes against Brighton in a game in which he desperately wanted to score. Maybe his parade was the beginning of the end, but it felt more like the start of the apology that should continue after the Africa Cup of Nations, giving both parties space to breathe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/13/was-salahs-return-the-beginning-of-the-end-at-liverpool-or-start-of-an-apology"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

That tournament can be seen in hindsight as a watershed for the English game, the first indication that the elite player performance plan (EPPP) and the England DNA project – taking youth football seriously – might be beginning to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youth football is notoriously unpredictable and England’s record in the Under-17 World Cup since shows a failure to qualify and a pair of last-16 exits, but following that 2017 success, England’s senior side have reached two European Championship finals and a World Cup semi-final, while the under-21s have won two European titles. Two previous Golden Ball winners from Under-17 World Cups – Cesc Fàbregas and Toni Kroos – have gone on to win the senior World Cup. Some, such as Landon Donovan, Anderson and Kelechi Iheanacho have had perfectly decent careers. And others have vanished almost entirely: Sani Emmanuel of Nigeria, for instance, won in 2009 then made just 16 senior appearances, 10 of them in the Swiss second tier with Biel-Bienne; while another Nigerian, Kelechi Nwakali, winner in 2015, joined Arsenal but, after a series of loan moves and stints in the lower reaches of the Spanish and Portuguese systems, was kicked out of Barnsley this past summer after returning late for pre-season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/13/phil-fodens-rocky-road-is-proof-that-a-prodigys-promise-is-no-guarantee-of-glory"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week’s weather system dumped 5tn gallons of rain on Washington state – and another one is threatening Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as record-level flood waters that triggered widespread evacuations begin to recede in western &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-state"&gt;Washington state&lt;/a&gt;, residents of the Pacific north-west are bracing themselves for another strong weather system that is likely to swell rivers back to dangerous levels – again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extraordinarily strong system known as an atmospheric river hit the region earlier this week, dropping &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/atmospheric-river-pacific-northwest-flooding-warming-9a175150afae172f2ebca27133abbd5b"&gt;more than a foot of rain&lt;/a&gt; and flooding rivers that stretch across the state toward &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; to dangerous levels. As a result of the nonstop rain, mudslides tore through communities, washing away homes and stranding families on rooftops as they waited for rescue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/atmospheric-river-washington-canada-pacific-north-west"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation signed deal in October, but president says tribe is now trying to exit contract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Native American tribe in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; is facing criticism from other tribal groups after its economic development subsidiary secured a $29.9m federal contract from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to design potential &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement"&gt;Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)&lt;/a&gt; detention facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development entity of &lt;a href="https://www.pbpindiantribe.com/"&gt;the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation&lt;/a&gt; signed the contract to design the detention facilities in October, leading to criticism that the tribal group, which was uprooted from the Great Lakes region to reservation lands north of Topeka, Kansas, in the 1830s, was itself benefiting from forced removals under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/kansas-native-american-tribe-ice-facilities"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real Madrid, who play on Sunday, now trail by seven points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leverkusen’s Terrier hits back-heel volley against Cologne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raphinha struck twice late in the second half as &lt;strong&gt;Barcelona&lt;/strong&gt; secured a hard-fought 2-0 victory over a resolute &lt;strong&gt;Osasuna&lt;/strong&gt; side, extending their lead at the top of La Liga to seven points. Hansi Flick’s men now sit on 43 points, comfortably clear of second-placed &lt;strong&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/strong&gt;, who have a game in hand and play at &lt;strong&gt;Alavés&lt;/strong&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their control of the game, Barcelona struggled to break down Osasuna’s deep defensive block until the 70th minute when Pedri’s incisive pass cut through the visitors’ defence, finding Raphinha in his stride. The Brazilian forward took a controlled touch before unleashing a thunderous strike from the edge of the area, the ball arrowing inside the left post to finally break the deadlock. Raphinha sealed the win in the 86th minute. A deflected cross from Jules Koundé on the right found the Brazilian unmarked at the far post, and he calmly volleyed the ball into an empty net, giving the scoreline a more comfortable look.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/13/european-roundup-atletico-madrid-valencia-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-ligue-1"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Multinational gas corporations are posting huge profits while people on low incomes are skipping meals, not cooling homes and going without medicines because they can’t afford their energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government must implement gas export market controls and avoid options that effectively subsidise gas companies or incentivise new polluting gas production. It’s time for this government to prioritise people over rich gas companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/dec/14/australia-news-live-michelle-rowland-family-travel-entitlements-labor-liberal-coles-woolworths-price-gouging-nsw-vic-wa-fire-weather-heatwave-warnings-albanese-sussan-ley-ntwnfb"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’re reluctant to discuss this with your parents – but doing so might help you shake off the feeling of injustice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am struggling with the different way &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my parents have treated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; me and my brother. My dad started &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a business when I was&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;five&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;worth several million. My brother was invited by my dad to go into the business when he left university. I was not. By th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;en, the business was well established and my &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dad &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stayed on as CEO. My &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dad &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gave my brother 80% of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He will now sell the business and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;realise &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;millions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, meaning he can retire early.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My dad &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;helped me with university fees and house purchases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. He’s told me I will inherit the house and whatever money is left&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; when &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my parents pass away, which is likely to be in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;about 20 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I doubt there will be anything left.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/14/my-dad-has-given-my-brother-80-of-his-business-and-i-feel-horribly-dismissed"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Baronesses Nadine and Ariane de Rothschild at odds over future of Swiss chateau’s priceless contents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three generations of genteel discretion bordering on secrecy, the international banking family the Rothschilds has been riven by rival claims to a multibillion-euro fortune including a vast collection of art masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle now playing out in the courts and media has pitched the 93-year-old senior baroness, Nadine de Rothschild – widow of Edmond de Rothschild, the late scion of the French-Swiss branch of the family – against her daughter-in-law, Ariane de Rothschild, the current baroness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/14/like-a-mini-louvre-two-generations-of-rothschilds-fight-over-treasure-trove-of-artworks"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The jailing of a Sudanese militia leader is an anomaly in a world where Putin, Netanyahu and yes, Hegseth, act without fear of international law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a rare success for international courts struggling to resist a rising tide of official lawlessness. Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman, a leader of the notorious, government-backed Janjaweed militia that committed genocide in Sudan’s Darfur region from 2003 to 2005, was &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-court-darfur-sentencing-abd-al-rahman-ab33a21572ac1a5c2d0ec4ee8547b57e"&gt;jailed for 20 years&lt;/a&gt; last week by the international criminal court (ICC). He had been found guilty on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although hundreds of militia were involved, Abd-al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, is the first person to be convicted of atrocities in Darfur, now again the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/03/blood-spilled-sudan-el-fasher-space-rsf-uae-darfur"&gt;scene of terrible violence&lt;/a&gt; in Sudan’s civil war. The ICC has charged Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s president at the time, with genocide and war crimes. Ahmad Harun, a former minister, faces similar charges. But both men have &lt;a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250129-icc-demands-sudan-hand-over-former-president-al-bashir/"&gt;evaded arrest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/14/icc-sudan-militia-leader-putin-netanyahu-hegseth-international-law"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forget homeschooling, how about taking your family on a perpetual gap year and quitting the nine-to-five? Families who did just that share the hostel horrors and mid-trip meltdowns behind the Instagram feed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was going to be the adventure of a lifetime. Late last year, Josy and Joe Davis decided to quit their jobs, sell their home and pull their two young daughters out of school to travel the world. Though their life in Gloucestershire was good on paper, post-pandemic it had been increasingly feeling like a grind. Josy, 35, a police dispatcher, worked shifts that swung from early morning to late night. Joe, also 35, a logistics manager, was often on call until 10pm. Neither felt as if they could ever switch off – let alone enjoy family time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhausted, Josy caught herself being short with her daughters, Lola and Zara, six and four. “I felt like I spent my days off recovering, rather than actually being present,” she says. Though only in Year 1, Lola was feeling the pressure at school, fretting about where she ranked in the class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/14/the-adventure-can-turn-into-a-disaster-the-digital-nomad-families-worldschooling-their-children"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Her delivery might be stilted – but Truss’ new YouTube show has grand ambitions: a ‘Trump revolution’ in Britain with the help of an influential US conservative ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz Truss, Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister, began the first edition of her YouTube show with a vow to unmask “the evil-doers” attempting to bring down Britain, the US and Europe. She would, she explained, reveal how an “international network of leftists work to subvert democracy and the will of the people”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her bleak monologue, Truss pointed to hope from across the Atlantic. “We’re going to look at the Trump revolution and see how this can be achieved in Britain,” she said. “We’ll be talking to the leading lights of the Maga movement.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/14/steve-bannon-tucker-carlson-and-liz-truss-former-pm-auditions-for-maga"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

You don’t recognise the brand, but the reviews are fantastic – five-star raves that say things such as “this product changed my life” and “this is the greatest air fryer ever”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You buy it, but when it arrives it is clearly cheap and poor quality, and possibly dangerous, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/dec/14/beware-five-star-reviews-fake-online-scam"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a hand in the kitchen, and in lieu of any sous elves, Claire Dinhut – AKA Condiment Claire – picks the ones that will make your feast sing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt, sweet, bitter, acid, umami. While we don’t think to use too much “sweet” before dessert, it can counterbalance and enhance other flavours. Maple syrup is my sweetener of choice during the holidays because it just tastes cozy. Add it to roasted root vegetables or a poultry glaze, and it’s especially tasty in drinks, from hot apple cider to eggnog and even mulled wine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/14/12-condiments-of-christmas-claire-dinhut-condiment-claire"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Another Chance star does Journey at karaoke and gets the party started with Daft Punk. But which Stevie Wonder track would he like played at his funeral?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first song I fell in love with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I grew up in New York City, so the emergence of hip-hop really connected with me when I was a kid.

      <title>‘It’s fun to go to war with God’: Will Sharpe and Paul Bettany on their sweaty, sacrilegious take on Amadeus</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/14/will-sharpe-paul-bettany-interview-amadeus-mozart-salieri</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last time the fierce enmity between Mozart and Salieri was adapted for the screen, it won a best picture Oscar. Now a new TV version turns up the temperature several notches – but will its stars develop a rivalry of their own?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A prodigal son story with God as the father,” is how actor Paul Bettany describes Amadeus, the Peter Shaffer play that became a celebrated film in 1984. Both depict the rivalry between Austrian court composer Antonio Salieri and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/mozart"&gt;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&lt;/a&gt;, a former child phenomenon whose towering talent exposes Salieri as mediocre and stuck in his ways. Salieri, who believes a composer’s gift to be divine, is so affronted by this upstart that he renounces God and sets about destroying Mozart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Amadeus has been remade for TV, with Will Sharpe in the title role and Bettany as Salieri. The series, which begins with Mozart arriving in Vienna in a rickety carriage and promptly throwing up in the street, is written by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/nov/06/the-lazarus-project-joe-barton-interview"&gt;Joe Barton&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Doves and Giri/Haji writer known for his leftfield approach to genre TV. Little surprise, then, that Amadeus takes liberties with the classic period drama, injecting it with modern-day dialogue and gloriously anarchic flourishes. While I won’t divulge the details of an early sex scene between Mozart and a young soprano, safe to say you won’t look at a macaron the same way again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/14/will-sharpe-paul-bettany-interview-amadeus-mozart-salieri"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nnena Kalu’s triumph for neurodivergent art has rattled a few cages. So let me put those carping critics right | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The artist’s winning Turner prize entry has been hailed for its life and energy, but to some dissenting voices its challenge to the status quo is hard to stomach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nnena Kalu is an artist. She is also, as of this week, a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/09/nnena-kalu-first-artist-learning-disability-win-turner-prize"&gt;winner of the Turner prize&lt;/a&gt;. Her work – twisting ribbon forms made from old VHS tape, plastic and strips of fabric – has been praised for its “finesse of scale, composition and colour” (the judges), its “emphasis … on the visual, tactile and experiential in art” (&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/nnena-kalu-turner-prize-2025-winner-b2881799.html"&gt;Mark Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, the Independent) and for being “so full of life and energy … so embodied, so sensuous” (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/09/nnena-kalus-embodied-sensuous-art-worthy-turner-prize-winner"&gt;Adrian Searle&lt;/a&gt;, this newspaper).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being an artist, Kalu also happens to be autistic, has a learning disability and does not communicate verbally as much as many neurotypical people (she is supported by the organisation ActionSpace). These things shouldn’t matter, and perhaps one day they won’t. However, neurodivergent artists have not historically been given much space by the art world, especially not those with learning disabilities. Four years ago, when Project Art Works – a collective of neurodivergent artists – was nominated for the prize, its CEO, Kate Adams, recounted to me how &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/23/turner-prize-rise-of-neurodiverse-art-project-herbert-coventry"&gt;she was told by&lt;/a&gt; a museum professional: “I don’t think it’s right [to have] people with learning disabilities in an exhibition downstairs with an artist of calibre upstairs. They shouldn’t be in the same building.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/14/nnena-kalu-turner-prize-neurodivergent-art"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the exam regulator consults about introducing onscreen exams amid complaints of hand fatigue, a young aspiring journalist goes head-to-head with a self-professed expert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week it was reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/11/gcses-a-levels-exams-england-laptops-2030-ofqual"&gt;students could soon be sitting their end-of-year exams on laptops&lt;/a&gt; after pupils complained of hand fatigue, saying their muscles “are not strong enough”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Ofqual preparing to launch a public consultation on the introduction of onscreen exams, we decided to conduct a test of our own, pitting the Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, a seasoned hack of the pen-and-paper generation, against George Francis Lee, our gen-Z journalist in training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/dec/14/pens-at-the-ready-a-gen-z-trainee-takes-on-the-guardians-scribbler-in-chief"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
